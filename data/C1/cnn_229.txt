Hillary Clinton sounded a populist tone in a fiery campaign appearance Wednesday, as she continued to unveil a political message ahead of the midterm elections.
 The other side has done everything it can to divide you, she told several thousand raucous fans in Louisville. This election is about the future. 
Clinton's speech comes as the former secretary of state moves back into the political sphere with a series of rallies for Democrats up this midterm cycle. On Wednesday, she rallied supporters of Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in a high-profile race.
 Let's put another crack in the glass ceiling, and elect this incredible young woman to the United States Senate, Clinton exhorted the cheering audience.
Clinton criticized McConnell and politicians in Washington for causing gridlock and slowing economic growth, and she lamented the avalanche of money outside groups are dumping into the midterm elections.
She urged Kentuckians to send a new voice to the Senate.
Some of her biggest applause lines centered on pocketbook issues such as raising the minimum wage and equal pay.
 Is n't it amazing that it's 2014, and we are still debating whether women deserve equal pay for equal work ? she asked. If there's only one reason that will motivate you to go vote in the next 20 days, put that at the top of the list. 
Clinton's visit to Kentucky comes a day after the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said it would stop running ads in support of Grimes.
On Thursday, Clinton heads to Michigan to campaign for Senate candidate Gary Peters and gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer.
