A bipartisan group of women senators waded into the ongoing drama over the NFL, Ray Rice and domestic violence.
They sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell calling on the football league to institute a real zero-tolerance policy in such cases.
The 16 signatories wrote that they were shocked and disgusted by the in-elevator video that surfaced of Ray Rice punching his then-fiance√© in an elevator, and they pointed to the allegation that the NFL had possession of the video, which became public Monday, when it handed down its original lenient two-game suspension.
 The NFL's current policy sends a terrible message to players, fans and all Americans that even after committing a horrific act of violence, you can quickly be back on the field, the senators wrote.
The NFL recently changed its domestic violence punishment to a minimum suspension of six games for a first offense and a lifetime time ban for a second offense.
 If you violently assault a woman, you should n't get a second chance to play football in the NFL, the senators wrote.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, recently told CNN that he would not rule out congressional action to force the NFL's hand on domestic abuse.
