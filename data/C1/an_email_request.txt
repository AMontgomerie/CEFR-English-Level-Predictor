Dear Ms Leitman,
I am writing to request your help following a change in my circumstances.
As you know, I am enrolled on the Basic Spanish course at your college, which starts in September. However, due to unforeseen family events, I have had to leave the country for a while to assist my parents in Hong Kong.
At present it is not clear when I will be able to return and unfortunately I will not be able to start the course as planned.
I would like to request a refund for the course fees already paid. I apologise for the short notice and for any inconvenience caused. In the event that a refund is not possible, I would be grateful if you could postpone my enrolment until my return.
Thank you in advance for your help and I hope to be able to update you on the situation soon.
Yours sincerely,
Honor Singh
