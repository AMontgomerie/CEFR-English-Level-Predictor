The 60 bishops from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay issued a statement after a meeting in Argentina last week, calling the practice a shameful and outrageous reality and pledging to do more to fight it.

Citing reports from global nonprofit groups, the bishops noted that child sex trafficking rings were also operating in the area.
The bishops pledged to raise awareness of the problem, push for legal reforms and assist victims -- noting that within the church there had been an absence of proposals dedicated to attracting young people -LRB- to the church -RRB-, and the absence of a more decisive and broad response to the problem -LRB- of human trafficking -RRB-.

Mario Ganora, a lawyer who works with La Alameda, an Argentinian nonprofit that helps victims of human trafficking, said the increase in human trafficking was connected to an increase in drug consumption.

According to official data from Argentina's Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, 176 people were rescued from human trafficking networks in Argentina in April, a higher number than the entire previous trimester.
