The ETF in question was one which tracked the volatile silver futures market and was priced in Swiss francs, they say. Adoboli's job would have been to hedge, or reduce, the bank's risk on the silver and franc positions by buying and selling each.
It is thought that he may accidentally have left the Swiss franc vs U.S. dollar side of the equation uncovered and got stung when the Swiss national bank intervened to defend the franc in early September.

As to the epidosde at UBS, Silva, the analyst, outlined three possible ways a loss that big could take place: intentional fraud, basic stupidity in trading strategy, or what the banking industry calls fat fingers, which means typing the wrong number by accident.
Perhaps the trader put in an extra zero so instead of buying a million he or she bought ten million -- could be a problem, Silva said.
Lex van Dam, a former trader who is now a partner at Hampstead Capital in London, said chaos in the markets could have put more pressure on a trader desperate to hang onto his job.
 Trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year, said van Dam. With the volatility in banking stocks, commodities and currencies, things can go wrong really, really easily. If you 're worried about your job and you try to hide -LRB- a mistake or loss -RRB-, you can see how these situations arise. 
A bank's risk management division is supposed to examine a trader's activities, he said.
 He must have done something that he was n't supposed to do, obviously, van Dam said.
UBS said no client positions were affected by the loss, which is still being investigated.

Yasuo Hamanaka cost Sumitomo Corporation $2.6 billion in the global copper market, and was sent to prison for eight years over fraud and forgery in 1997.
Nick Leeson, the subject of the Ewan McGregor movie Rogue Trader, lost about $1.3 billion for his bank, Barings, in 1995, forcing it to close.
UBS is not likely to collapse, but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company, van Dam said.
There is a much higher chance that this bank will now be broken up into a wealth managament firm and an investment bank to reduce clientsexposure to investment banking losses, he said.
He favors that alternative, he said.
 The banks are too large, van Dam said. The products are so complicated, and the management does n't understand it. 
UBS made a pre-tax profit of about $1.9 billion in the second quarter of this year, it announced in July, down from about $2.5 billion the quarter before that.
