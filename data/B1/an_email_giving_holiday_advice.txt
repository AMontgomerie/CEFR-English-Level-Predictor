Hi Sunny!
How are you?
We're finally coming to Singapore so I wanted to ask your advice on what we should do while we're there. What shouldn't we miss? We'll have our two kids aged 6 and 8 with us so ideally we want to do things we can enjoy as a family.
We've already got a hotel booked in Marina Bay and we arrive on 12 May for a week.
I hope you're around so we can meet up!
See you soon,
Janet

Hi Janet!
Lovely to hear from you and how exciting that you're coming!
You've picked a great area to stay in as it's right next to a must-see attraction, Gardens by the Bay. They light them up at night and the kids will love it. Another place to take the little ones is the zoo, and the Night Safari is really worth doing. The animals are much more active at night than during the day, so it's pretty special.
As for food, there's quite a variety here. I'd recommend trying laksa and kaya toast â€“ they're both really typical Singaporean foods. You can also eat well and cheaply at street markets. You should definitely check them out.
Can't wait to see you all!
Sunny
