Rockefeller Center is a complex of 19 buildings. It is named for a famous New York City business magnate, John D. Rockefeller, who built the group of buildings from 1930-1939. The most famous building in the complex is the General Electric building where NBC television studios are based. It is smack in the middle of Manhattan, New York City, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and between 48th and 51st Streets. The address of the GE building is 30 Rockefeller Plaza. That's how the show "30 Rock" got its name. The show was filmed there. Saturday Night Live, a popular American late night show, is also filmed there. Visitors can get tickets to see a show being taped and can also tour the studios.
 
Visitors to Rockefeller Center can visit the plaza, which becomes an ice skating rink in the winter. Every year a huge Christmas tree is placed there and thousands of people attend the tree lighting ceremony, which always features famous singers. In the spring, summer, and fall, the plaza becomes a cafe. In the middle of the plaza is a statue of the Greek god Prometheus. His myth states that he brought fire to the world. 200 flags from all countries of the United Nations surround the plaza.
Radio City Music Hall is another famous building in Rockefeller Center. Many musicians give concerts here, but it is best known as the home of the Rockettes, a dance company named for Rockefeller Center. They are famous for their kick lines and are best known for performing in the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, an annual musical holiday stage show.
