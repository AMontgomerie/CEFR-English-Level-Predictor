Martha is at the grocery store, getting ready for a house party. She has a list of what she needs with her as she goes along. The first section she comes has produce. Martha sees apples, bananas, cherries, grapes, and strawberries. She checks her list:
- 6 apples
- 1 bag of cherries
- 1 bag of grapes
- 2 cartons of strawberries
Martha gets her items and looks the bananas. They are on sale for much cheaper than they are normally. She picks 3 bananas. Next are vegetables. She sees potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, and salad in bags. She checks her list:
- 5 pounds of potatoes
- 6 carrots
- 4 tomatoes
- 2 onions
- 4 mushrooms
As she is putting her items into her cart, Martha checks the many bags of salad and chooses 2 of them. She pushes her cart ahead. The next section is meat and dairy. She sees meat, fish, cheese, eggs, and milk. She checks her list:
- 2 fish (salmon)
- 1 block of cheese (cheddar)
- 1 dozen eggs
- 2 gallons of milk
She looks at the meat that is on sale and chooses a 5-pound roll of hamburger. She gets the rest of the items in that section. She still needs rice, bread, salt, sugar, and flour. She gets:
- 2 bags of rice
- 4 loaves of bread
- a 2-pound bag of sugar
- a 2-pound bag of flour
Martha then realizes that she has forgotten something. She runs back and gets 1 container of salt and then rushes to the checkout. She puts her groceries into her car and leaves.
