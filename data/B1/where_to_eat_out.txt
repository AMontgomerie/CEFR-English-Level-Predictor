A Henry’s B The Riverbank Restaurant
Henry’s is located in the heart of
London, with clubs, theatres and
bars all around. It serves fast food
and attracts a young crowd. It’s a
great place to go at any time
especially if you want to keep the
price down. It’s open from midday
to midnight.
For a relaxing lunch where you
won’t be disturbed, try the
Riverbank Restaurant. It has a
different Italian dish on its
menu each day. Customers are
willing to pay high prices here
because of the excellent service
and beautiful views.
C Country Delights D The Grand
Country Delights serves interesting
vegetarian dishes, using the
freshest vegetables in a seasonally
changing menu. Prices are higher
than average but it’s worth the extra
for the good service and relaxed
atmosphere. It’s open for lunch
only, as it’s used for private parties
in the evening.
The Grand is spread over two floors
and is huge. It’s a great favourite for
any group with a reason to celebrate.
It’s usually full because of the live
music and interesting choices on the
menu. Group bookings can benefit
from some super offers. Open every
night from eight till late.
E The Venue F Peppercorns
Situated right in the heart of
London’s commercial centre, this
busy restaurant is very convenient
for business lunches or dinners.
You’ll enjoy typical English and
Italian dishes at reasonable
prices, but it does get noisy and
the service can be slow.
This excellent vegetarian restaurant
looks onto its own beautiful
gardens, and you can have dinner
outside at certain times of the year.
Don’t expect this dining experience
to be quick, as the chef takes great
care with each dish. Not cheap, but
well worth it.
G Beat H Star
Lively and popular, this Italian café is
where all young professional people
meet for lunch. Open until five
every day, you’ll find some of the
most fantastic food around at the
lowest prices. The live music and
atmosphere are both great, but the
queues for food are sometimes long.
What a great find! Star’s dining room
is really one of the most beautiful in
London and is in the perfect location
for both shoppers and theatre-goers.
For a leisurely lunch or dinner, Star
offers great value for money, and
allows you to relax in comfort. There’s
a wide range of dishes available,
including some excellent vegetarian
choices
