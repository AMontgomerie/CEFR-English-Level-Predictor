The next time you decide to check your Facebook page to see if you have any new messages, likes, or just to see what your friends are up to, you can thank Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg is the man who changed the way people keep in touch with each other. He literally changed the world.
 
Born in White Plains, New York on May 14, 1984, Zuckerberg developed an interest in computer programming at an early age. When he was just 12 years old, he had developed a working messaging system that his father Edward used in his dental office. Zuckerberg had many friends who were artists, and they would come by and draw pictures for Mark. He would then design a computer game based on the characters drawn. In high school, Zuckerberg developed a music software program that drew interest from several large companies. He enrolled into Harvard University in 2002, where he developed his first social networking site for students only. The site was very popular, but it was shut down by the school for being inappropriate.
During his sophomore year at Harvard, Zuckerberg began working on Facebook, a site that allowed its users to create a profile, share photos, and communicate with other members. He dropped out his sophomore year to dedicate his work to his site. He moved his operation to Palo Alto, California. By the end of 2004, Facebook had had more than 1,000,000 members.
Zuckerberg's rise to the top has not been without controversy. Some of his Harvard peers claimed he stole their ideas, and filed suit against Zuckerberg. The case was settled, but it continues to be an issue. Facebook generates more than $1.5 billion in net revenues today.
