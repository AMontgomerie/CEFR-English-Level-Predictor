Barbara dropped out of college 17 years ago when she had her first daughter. She always regretted dropping out. She had been a good student, and enjoyed going to classes in college. However, when she had her daughter, she didn't have time to continue with her studies. She needed to find a full-time job.
 
Barbara also regretted dropping out of college because it was hard to find a good job without a college degree. While Barbara was lucky enough to always find work, some of the jobs she had didn't pay well. Most of them didn't offer benefits like vacation pay and health insurance. Barbara was sure that if she had a college degree, finding a better-paying job with benefits would be easier.
Barbara's daughter was now a teenager. She was beginning to look at colleges. This inspired Barbara to go back to school herself. Barbara wanted to finally get her bachelor's degree. Since her daughter was in high school, Barbara had more time. She didn't have to constantly watch over her daughter. However, even as a teenager, Barbara's daughter still needed to eat and needed clothes, so going to college on a regular schedule was not an option for Barbara.
Barbara went to the local community college to learn about her options. A college counselor told her that she could take online classes to finish her degree. Barbara was worried that these classes wouldn't give the same credit as a traditional college class would. The counselor told her the credits were the same, and online classes were good for non-traditional students like her. Barbara enrolled and became a student again.
