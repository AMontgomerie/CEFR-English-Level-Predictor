Here's one way to make your iPhone hacker-proof: Ask hackers for advice.
I recently caught up with security researchers at the online security conference Infiltrate. At dinner one evening, I placed my iPhone on the table. I was surrounded by ethical hackers whose jobs are to find vulnerabilities before the bad guys and exploit security flaws.
 I could hack your phone pretty easily, security researcher Tomi Tuominen mentioned. Obviously, I took notice.
For the next 20 minutes, Tuominen and information security researcher Robert Lee gave me a tutorial on making my iPhone settings hacker-proof. Some of them are basic -- like changing your four character password to something more complex. Others take a bit more work, such as using settings to limit ad tracking.
