In the social media age, you do n't need to be at a party to enjoy clever or catty comments about the Super Bowl.
Twitter was ablaze Sunday evening with running commentary about every conceivable aspect of Super Bowl XLVI, from Patriotstight end Rob Gronkowski's balky ankle to Madonna's acrobatic halftime show to all those commercials. -LRB- Yes, Clint Eastwood's gravelly voice is bringing Detroit back. And was that really Motley Crue shilling for Kia ? -RRB-
Users were sending an average of 8,000 tweets per second during Madonna's world peace - themed performance and an average of 10,000 tweets per second during the game's dramatic final three minutes, according to Twitter.
