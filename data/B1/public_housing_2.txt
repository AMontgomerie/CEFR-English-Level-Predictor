When you apply for public housing, on the application you need to give the names and ages of everyone who will live with you. You will also need to give the address of where you currently live and a phone number which you can be contacted with.
 
In your application, you need to explain why you think you qualify for public housing help. Some reasons can include being a veteran, being poor, or living in bad conditions. Bad conditions can mean that the place you are living now is dangerous or it can mean that you are in a domestic violence situation. The government will also want to know the name and contact information of your current landlord and any landlords you had in the past. This is so that the government can find out if you are a good tenant. You will also need to tell the government how much money you make in a year and how you make that money. You can't just make that information up. You will need to provide your boss's information, old checks, and bank statements.
The government may visit you in your current home and interview you and people you live with. Other things the government will ask for are your birth certificate and the birth certificates of all people who will live with you and proof that you pay taxes, like a tax return. If you are eligible for any public housing assistance, you will get a letter. If you're approved, you'll be put on a waiting list. You may be on the waiting list for a long time before you actually can move into a public housing unit. This is because there are many people applying and eligible for help. Sometimes you can be waiting for years.
