Linda got an email from the theater. It said that she could pick up the tickets at the theater. Anthony took Linda out to eat before they went to the theater to wait in line. Anthony was excited because the movie they were going to see was the sequel to one of Anthony's favorite movies. When they got to the theater, Anthony and Linda went to the back of the line and started talking to the people in the back. They all seemed friendly, and some of them actually knew Anthony and Linda.
After about an hour of waiting in line, the theater started letting people in. Anthony hugged Linda and started jumping up and down. Linda loved going to the theater with Anthony.
