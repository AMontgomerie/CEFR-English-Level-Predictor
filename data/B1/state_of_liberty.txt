Most people don't know that the full name of the Statue of Liberty is "The Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World". She is a symbol of freedom, especially for many immigrants. When many immigrants came to the United States in the late 1800s, Lady Liberty in New York Harbor was a sign to tell them that they had made it to America. Inside the base of the statue there is a plaque with a famous poem written on it. The poem is "The New Colossus" by Emma Lazarus. Many immigrants feel this poem speaks to them the reasons they came to America. One line of the poem is: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free". Lady Liberty was not always green. She used to be copper colored, but the years have caused the copper that the statue is made of to change color.
 
The 151-foot tall sculpture was a 100th birthday gift from France to the United States in 1886. It is located on Liberty Island right off the southern tip of Manhattan, New York City. The only way to get there is to take a ferry. Inside the base of the statue is a museum. To get to the crown, people have to climb 377 steps up a double spiral staircase from the feet of the statue. There is no elevator. People need to be in good shape to climb to the top. People used to be able to climb up to the torch of the statue, but it was shut down because it was too easy to fall off.
About four million people visit the Statue of Liberty every year. People who can't go to New York can see replicas in Las Vegas and other parts of the world.
