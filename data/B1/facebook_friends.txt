Katherine loved Facebook. With Facebook she could keep in contact with her family no matter how far away they were. She could see photographs of her cousins and read status updates from her aunts and uncles. With Facebook she could keep her relatives up to date on what she was doing. With a few taps on the keyboard and hitting the send button, she could tell a dozen or more people about her new job. She could also send pictures so that they wouldn't worry that she wasn't eating enough or was unhealthy.
 
Another thing Katherine loved about Facebook was that she didn't have to think about time zones when updating family. Whenever she called her parents or other relatives, she always had to think about the time difference so that she wouldn't wake someone up or call when she knew they were at church. Facebook was so convenient.
Another thing happened when Katherine joined Facebook though. Some people she went to high school with started to add her as a friend. At first, this didn't bother her. She loved learning about the success of people she knew when she was just a teenager. She loved finding out people were getting married, having babies, and traveling.
Soon however, Katherine found herself comparing herself to the people she was reading about on Facebook. It began to make her feel bad that some people seemed to be doing so much better than she was. They had better jobs, nicer clothes, and cuter boyfriends. She was also spending a lot of time on Facebook. It took a lot of time and energy to keep up with everyone's status updates.
Katherine started to think. She looked at the list of over 500 friends she had on Facebook and realized some of them were not really friends at all.
