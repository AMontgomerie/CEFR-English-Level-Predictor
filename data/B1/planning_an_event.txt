Event planning team
online
Alright, so I've divided up the tasks among the three of us planning this event like this:
@Jen: make guest list, schedule social media announcements, arrange room set-up, organise musicians
@Ed: book catering, send out invitations, design posters, book speakers
@Mike: reserve rooms, design invitations, write and publish blog post, get emcee
But please don't feel like we need to stick to this. If you prefer to do something else, feel free to say so.

Yeah, I was thinking, as you are project leader @Mike, maybe it's best you make the guest list? I've got experience in graphic design so I'm happy to design the invitations.
Jen, 14:50
@Jen, do you mind designing the posters too? I'm not very good at designing.
Ed, 14:55
Sure, it'll be fun. If I take the poster design off you @Ed, do you think you can organise the musicians?
Jen, 14:56
Absolutely, I know some really good musicians that do events like this one. And I also know a really good emcee. Do you want me to take over getting the emcee too?
Ed, 14:58
@Ed I actually already have an emcee in mind so I think I'll handle that. I'd appreciate it if you could write and publish the blogpost about the event though.
Mike, 15:01
That's not a problem. I quite enjoy online marketing tasks.
Ed, 15:01
If that's the case, @Ed do you want to schedule the social media announcements too?
Jen, 15:03
I can do that ... if someone books the speakers.
Ed, 15:04
I'll book the speakers. And since I'm making the guest list, I should send out the invitations too. @Jen, are you still okay with arranging the room set-up?
Mike, 15:08
Yes, let me do the room reservations as well.
Jen, 15:09
Good idea. That would work nicely.
