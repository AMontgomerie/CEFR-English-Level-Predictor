An evacuation order was lifted Wednesday morning for more than 500 California homes on hillsides vulnerable to mudslides, authorities said.
With the sun shining over much of Los Angeles, officials told people who live in the foothill areas of La Crescenta, La Canada Flintridge and Acton that they could return to their homes at 8 a.m. PT -LRB- 11 a.m. ET -RRB-.
Officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for those residents Tuesday morning as a precaution when heavy rains were predicted.
The dangerous mudslides did not develop, but this area was especially hit hard after a downpour Saturday unleashed a river of mud that damaged dozens of homes.
Several of the homes were declared uninhabitable.
A massive wildfire in the Angeles National Forest last summer burned hillsides where these homes are located.
