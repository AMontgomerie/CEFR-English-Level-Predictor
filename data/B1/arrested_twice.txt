 
Donald had a rough morning. He had an argument with his wife, so he thought it would be a good idea to finish a six-pack of beer and a handful of prescription pain pills. This would have been fine if he had stayed inside his house. Instead, drunk and high, Donald began to harass his next-door neighbor. First he banged on his neighbor's door. Then he broke the glass panel of a porch light. Finally he ripped the light's wires out of the wall. That was the last straw. The neighbor called the police. The police came and arrested Donald for public intoxication and disturbing the peace. Donald was taken to a nearby jail. His stay only lasted a few hours. As soon as he was more sober, the police released him. Apparently, Donald wasn't quite sober enough though.
 
When he was released, Donald realized he was pretty far from his home. He didn't feel like walking almost two miles, so he called his friend from the jail to come get him. But Donald was getting impatient. When a woman got out of her car in the parking lot, he tried to get in. The woman screamed for help. Donald screamed, "But this is my car!" The woman kept screaming and Donald got out. He then thought it would be a good idea to take the bus home. A deputy was watching and arrested Donald again, after he had only been free for one hour. This time, however, Donald's jail stay would not be as short. He was charged with attempted burglary. A judge set his bail at $10,000. He didn't have $10,000, so he is still in jail awaiting trial.
