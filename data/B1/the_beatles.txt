The Beatles are an English group of musicians from Liverpool, England. It took America by storm with their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show on primetime television. The group's first appearance was seen by more than 73 million viewers in February, 1964, introducing the band to the American people. In the months to follow, the group became the biggest Rock â€˜N' Roll band ever to hit the United States.
 
The group's success opened the door for other British bands to make their way to America. Bands such as the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks and The Dave Clark Five were soon playing their music to American audiences.
The Beatles were made up by four of the finest musicians to ever play rock music. Their lead singer was Paul McCartney, and drummer Ringo Starr. Both still play to this day. Two of the original members, singers and songwriters, John Lennon, and George Harrison, have tragically passed away, but their music lives in American culture to this day. The Beatles have sold more records in the United States than any other country in the world.
There was controversy in the U.S. prior to the group's first appearance. Conservative Americans viewed the Beatles as upstarts, with brash, new ideas, lyrics, and sound. The young generation of the time was ready for a change, and the Beatles gave them what they wanted. They were nicknamed the "Mop Tops" because of their long, bowl-like haircuts that flew in the face of convention in the 60s. Nothing was going to stop the Beatles though. Their music is as popular today as it was 50 plus years ago. This February, the Grammy Awards presented a special telecast celebrating the 50th anniversary of the group's first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.
