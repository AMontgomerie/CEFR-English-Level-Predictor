Come in, please. Take a seat wherever you like.
Thank you. It's been a long and hot day.
It has been a hot one. Would you like something to drink?
What do you have?
We have soda, juice, and bottled water.
I'll take bottled water, and my wife would like one, too.
Sounds good. Would you like it in a glass with ice?
Yes, that sounds wonderful.
We also have some slices of pineapple. Would you like some?
Pineapple would hit the spot. I would love some.
Does your wife want some as well?
Actually, she doesn't like pineapple. Thanks, anyway.
