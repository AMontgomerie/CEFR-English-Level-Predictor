Good morning. How are you today?
I'm fantastic. How about yourself?
That's great! I'm good, but I feel a little sick.
That's not good. I heard there is a flu going around.
Well, I have to be sure to take good care of myself.
Sucks that you aren't feeling well, it's a nice day.
It is. The sunshine makes me want to go to the beach.
That's a great idea, but I think you'll get sicker if you go.
True. Perhaps we can go some other time?
For sure. Let's get together next week and go if you're better.
Sounds like a plan. I'll talk to you later.
Cool, see you later.
