It's 4 a.m. already? I have to be getting home.
You can stay over if you want. I have an extra bed.
I appreciate the gesture, but I must get home.
Do you want to hang out tomorrow night?
I would love that. I will call you after I get out of work.
What time do you get out?
If my boss isn't there, I should be getting out at around 8:00 p.m.
And if your boss is there?
Then I will be getting out sometime around 10:00 p.m.
Great. We could go grab a drink after you get out of work.
That sounds lovely, good night.
Good night. Drive home safely.
