This is a great book you're checking out.
You have read it?
Read it? I memorized it! It's one of my favorites.
That's good to know.
You should check out more books.
I can check out more than one?
Of course! It would be crazy if you could only get one book.
That's awesome! I'll be back.
Don't go crazy now. The limit is 15 books.
Don't worry. I'll probably come back with 5 more books.
It's great to see a kid excited about reading.
Yeah, most kids hate reading. They're more into television.
