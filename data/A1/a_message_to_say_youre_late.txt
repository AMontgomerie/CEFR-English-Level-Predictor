I'm running 10 mins late, sorry!
No problem!
Aargh! Traffic is really bad. I'll be more than 10 mins late now, sorry again!!
It's OK, don't worry. I'm in the café already so it’s fine
This is not my day! I'm here but can't find a place to park. I'm looking for a different car park. Not sure how long I'll be
OK, LMK when you find a place
I might get something to eat tho
Of course! I'll be as quick as I can
OK!
Found one! Be there in 10 mins
Well done! See you soon
Thx for waiting
