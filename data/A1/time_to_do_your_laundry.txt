I don't have any clean laundry for tomorrow!
Well, you should do your laundry then.
Laundry is such a hassle!
Pack the laundry bags and let's go to the Laundromat.
Oh, alright. I don't have much, though.
Do you have any quarters?
Yes. I have enough for the washer and dryer.
Alright then, let's get going.
This is going to take forever.
The longer you keep complaining, the longer it'll feel.
I'd rather be playing video games.
I'd rather you wore a clean shirt to school tomorrow.
