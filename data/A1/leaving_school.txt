I have to leave class early tomorrow.
I don't like that. Just don't come to class.
Don't be like that, Professor! I have to attend my mom's funeral.
I'm sorry for your loss.
It's okay. I'm going to miss her.
I lost my mom when I was in college, too.
Saddest thing ever, right?
Yes. You know what? Take a week off school.
I can't do that. I have too many responsibilities.
Take my advice.
I'll think about it.
If you ever need to talk, my door is open.
