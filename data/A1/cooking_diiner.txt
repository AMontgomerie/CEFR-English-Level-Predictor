Hello, is this the Smith residence?
What's for dinner?
I should be asking you that.
What? Why do you say that?
You're old enough to cook dinner.
Are you saying it's my turn now?
Actually, that's exactly what I'm saying.
What would you like to eat, then?
I'm craving some spaghetti, bread, and even a salad.
Frozen pizza it is, then!
You are so lazy! Can you even cook?
Of course I can cook! I choose not to.
You're having hot pockets for dinner tomorrow.
