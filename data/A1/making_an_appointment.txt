Hello? I'd like to schedule an appointment.
Hello! What time would you like to come in?
Well, I only like Jane cutting my hair.
Jane comes in to work at 3 p.m. today.
That sounds perfect! Sign me up.
You'll be coming in for a haircut, yes?
I'd also like to redo my highlights.
That will be no problem. Can I have your name?
My name is Sarah.
Alright, Sarah, we'll be expecting you!
Alright, thank you!
See you soon!
