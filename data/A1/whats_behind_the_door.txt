Dotty looked at the door. It was a closet door. The door had a silver handle. The silver handle was round. The round, silver handle was a doorknob. One day she tried to turn the doorknob. She tried to open the closet door. But the doorknob didn't turn. She couldn't open the closet door. The closet door wouldn't open. The door was locked. "Why is the door locked?" Dotty asked her mom. Her mom said it was locked for her safety. "What's behind the door?" she asked her mom. Her mom said a rifle was behind the locked door. Daddy kept a rifle in the closet.
