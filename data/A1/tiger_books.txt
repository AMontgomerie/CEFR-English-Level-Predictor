Hi, can you help me find a book on tigers?
Yes, of course. Is it for a school project?
Yes, I'm doing an essay on the life of a tiger.
You're going to want one with a lot of words and less pictures.
But I want the one with pictures!
Pictures are pretty, but they won't help you with your essay that much.
Fine, I admit you're right.
You can borrow the book with pictures for your own pleasure.
Yay! I love tigers.
I have a book that isn't hard to understand, but still has great information.
Great! You're so helpful.
It's my job to be helpful.
