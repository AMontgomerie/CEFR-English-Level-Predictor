He looked for his cell phone. It was on top of the TV. He couldn't find his glasses. Where are my glasses, he wondered. He looked for his glasses. They were on top of his head.

Where is my toothbrush, he wondered. He played his tiny video recorder. He found his toothbrush. He didn't have to look for it.
