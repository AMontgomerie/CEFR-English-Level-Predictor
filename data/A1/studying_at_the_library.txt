I can't study at home, because my family talks so loudly.
Study at the library.
Can you focus in there?
Yes, it's always really quiet.
I'll go today.
Make sure you get a good seat.
Are there not enough seats for everyone?
It depends on when you go.
I'm going at 1:00 a.m.
Dude, it's not even open that late.
But that's the best time for me.
You can always try a cafe. They tend to close late or not at all.
