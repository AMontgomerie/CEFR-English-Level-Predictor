Hello, is this the Smith residence?
David! Clean your room. It's filthy!
It's not so bad, mom.
I don't even remember what color the carpet is!
It's blue, I remember.
Have you no shame?
What should I be ashamed of?
There are clothes all over the ground!
It's just easier to leave them there.
Your floor is not a gigantic closet.
I never said it was.
Clean your room or you can't go out today.
Fine, fine. I'll clean it now.
