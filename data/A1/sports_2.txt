My baseball game starts at 2 p.m. today. Will you be there?
Yes, I will definitely be there.
Great! I will tell my family to save you a seat.
What position will you be playing?
I will be playing first base, but the coach may switch me.
If he switches you, what position will you play?
I think he wants me to pitch.
You are a pitcher as well?
Yes, I am. I'm still training, but I can throw.
I didn't know that about you.
Well, hopefully you can see me pitch today.
Awesome! I can't wait.
