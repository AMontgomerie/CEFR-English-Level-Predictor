I would like to purchase the book for Sociology 130.
May I see your student ID?
I didn't know we needed it.
Please go get your ID, and get in line again.
But I waited in line for two hours!
I'm sorry, but you need a student ID to purchase textbooks here.
Are there any other options?
Show me proof that you're a student at this college, and you'll be good.
I have my report card. Here it is.
This will do. Nice grades by the way.
Thanks! I worked very hard for them.
Good luck with this semester.
