Subject: Booking 2 nights next week
Dear Ascot Hotel,
I would like to reserve an accessible single room for two nights with breakfast on the 22 and 23 of April. Could I have a quiet room with a view if possible, please?
I will arrive at about 10 p.m. and I have an early meeting the next morning, so please could you leave an iron and ironing board in the room?
I have a promotional code (MH2219). Please can you confirm that it is Â£80 per night with breakfast included?
Please could you confirm the booking? Let me know if you need any further information.
Many thanks.
With kind regards,
David Mathews
