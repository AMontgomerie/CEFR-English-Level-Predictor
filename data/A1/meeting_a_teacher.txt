Hello, Mr. Smith. It's nice to finally meet you.
Likewise, Mrs. Jones. Please sit down.
Is James in trouble again?
Actually, no, he's not.
What's the purpose of this meeting exactly?
I just wanted to let you know that James is doing very well.
Oh, is that right? I'm so proud!
He has been staying for tutoring and his marks have skyrocketed!
I always knew he had it in him!
He behaves better in the classroom, too.
I do believe my James is growing up!
All children need to mature is motivation!
