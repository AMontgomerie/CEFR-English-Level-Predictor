Hello, please connect me to Tech Support.
This is Tech Support, how may I help you?
I am having problems with my Internet service.
What seems to be the problem?
None of my wireless devices are connecting to the Wi-Fi.
I see. Have you tried disconnecting and reconnecting the modem?
No, how do I do that?
Simply unplug the modem for fifteen seconds.
Alright. I plugged it in again.
Are all of the lights back on the modem?
Yes, they're all green!
Your devices should be able to connect easily now.
Oh, they're working perfectly! Thank you!
