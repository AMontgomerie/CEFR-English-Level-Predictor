It was September. People were getting sick all over the world. They were getting sick from the flu. The flu was called H1N1. Some people called it swine flu. The swine farmers did not like that. They said, "Stop calling it swine flu. Swine don't have the flu. You can't get the flu from eating swine." Swine are also called pigs. We get bacon and ham from pigs. We get pork from pigs. But we don't get the flu from pigs. We get the flu from a virus. The H1N1 virus was making everyone sick. In October they distributed a new vaccine. The new vaccine protected most people from the virus. The people were happy. The swine farmers were happy.
