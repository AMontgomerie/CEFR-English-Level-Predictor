May I turn in my homework tomorrow?
It's due today.
I know, but I don't have it right now.
How come? Your dog ate it?
No! I left it at home.
I can't take your word for it.
Why not? I'm an A+ student.
How do I know if you even did the homework?
I'll ask my mom to take a picture of it and send it to me.
That's fair enough.
Thanks. Also, you should try trusting students more. We're not all that bad.
I'll try, but I can't promise anything.
