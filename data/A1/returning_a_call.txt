Hello, is this Mr. Smith? I'm Mrs. Jones.
Hello, Mrs. Jones. Did you get my message?
Yes, I did, I'm returning your call.
Oh, right, of course.
What's the problem? Is James in trouble?
I caught him copying a classmate's test today.
Oh, that child is incorrigible!
I'm afraid I'll have to give him detention this time.
It's alright, I understand.
James certainly is strong-willed.
Yes, he needs a firm hand and discipline!
He's a good boy. Now if only he'd stop cheating!
