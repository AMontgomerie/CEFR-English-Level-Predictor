What do you plan to do after you graduate from here?
I'm planning to go to medical school. You?
I'm planning to teach English in underprivileged countries.
That's really kind of you.
Thanks. The first country I'm teaching in is Kenya.
While you're at Kenya, I'll be studying for medical school.
What kind of doctor do you want to be?
I want to be a pediatrician.
Because you like kids?
I don't really have a good reason. I just think I'll be good at it.
You should do what you love, not necessarily what you're good at.
That is very cheesy advice.
