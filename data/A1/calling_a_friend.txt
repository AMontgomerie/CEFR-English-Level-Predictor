Why don't you ever answer your phone?
I'm usually busy. What's up?
I wanted to see if you were down to kick it.
Where do you want to go? I don't have that much money.
Let's go for a drink at the bar where we went last week.
Okay, but I only have enough for three beers.
It's fine. I'll pay for the rest, but you owe me.
Screw that, I paid for you last time. You owe me!
Well, then we can call it even.
I guess so. Where should we meet?
How about at the train station by the bar?
Sounds good. I'll see you in an hour.
Great. See you then, laters.
