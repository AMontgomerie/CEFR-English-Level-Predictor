Herman didn't like his first name. He had never liked it. He wanted to change it. He asked his mother. She said it was too late to change his name. She said he could use his middle name. She would call him by his middle name. She asked him if that was okay. Herman said yes. "From now on," he said, "please call me by my middle name. From now on, please call me Adam." His mother said that was no problem. "Goodbye, Herman," she said, "and hello, Adam." When Adam's father came home from work, Adam's mom said, "Guess what? We have a new son."
