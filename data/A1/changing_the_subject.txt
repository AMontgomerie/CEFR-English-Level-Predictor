Can I ask you a question?
Sure, go ahead.
How is your relationship with your parents?
It's good. I get along with my father more than I do with my mother.
If I may ask, why is that?
I'm not comfortable answering that. Why are you asking?
It's for a class project. Why don't you get along with your mother?
What class are you doing this for?
It's for my psychology class. Do you live with your dad or mom?
I live with my dad.
Do you think that's why you don't get along with your mom?
I said I'm not comfortable talking about that. Change the subject.
