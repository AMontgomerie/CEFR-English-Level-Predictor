Subject: Things to do for the team meeting
Tim,
We have a team meeting in Room 310 on Friday 26 November at 11 a.m. We are expecting 25 members of our international team there.
Could you please book the room for us? 
Would you please prepare 25 pens and notepads for the meeting? 
Also, can you write an email to the team members to tell them the time and place of the meeting?
Thanks very much for your help. If you have any questions about this just let me know â€“ I'll be in the office tomorrow morning.
Best,
Amelia
