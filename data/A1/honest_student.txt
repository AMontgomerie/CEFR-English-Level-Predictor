I have to tell you something.
What is it?
You graded my test incorrectly. I got this wrong, but you didn't mark it.
Wow! I have never met a more honest student.
I just felt wrong.
Just keep the score you have.
Really? That's awesome.
Yes. I have to ask, why did you decide to tell me?
I'm really bad at lying.
That's a good thing! Your honesty is praiseworthy.
Thanks. Want to give me extra credit?
Don't push it.
