That's an awesome shirt.
Thank you. It's so nice of you to say.
Where did you get it?
I got it at a store at the mall.
The mall? Did it cost a lot? Things are usually overpriced there.
Actually, it was quite cheap. I got it for $15.99.
That is pretty cheap. Do they have it in other colors?
You want to go get one?
Yeah, I like how it looks. Would you want to come with me?
We can go after school, if you want?
That would be great. I need new clothes, but I don't know what to buy.
I'll help you pick out something cute.
