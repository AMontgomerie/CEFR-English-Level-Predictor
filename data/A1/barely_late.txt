Here are the books I'm returning.
Looks like they're late. The late fee is $5.
Okay, I'm only one minute late.
One minute late, one month late, one year late, it doesn't matter.
Are you kidding me? There's a big difference between one minute and one month.
Look, the point is - they're late.
Screw you! I ain't payin $5.
I guess you'll never borrow another book, magazine, or video here ever again.
It's okay, because I don't even like this library.
This library doesn't like you either!
I am leaving! You are plain rude.
Leave! Nobody wants to see you.
