Can I borrow your class notes from yesterday's lecture?
Heck no! You're so lazy.
What are you talking about? I was sick yesterday.
I don't care. Ask someone else.
You're so mean!
I can't let anyone borrow my class notes.
Why not? They're just notes.
I let a classmate borrow my notes once, and she sold copies to people.
That's crazy! For how much?
She sold each class note set for $5.
Don't worry, I promise not to sell your notes.
I can't take your word for it.
