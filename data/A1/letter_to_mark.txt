Dear Sarah,
How are you? I’m fine. I’m having a wonderful time in France. My course is great and I’m enjoying learning French. Paris is a very old and interesting city. There are lots of beautiful old buildings to visit. I am staying with a French family. They are very nice and I feel very welcome
in their house. I usually have dinner with the family in the evening. They don’t speak English so I can practice my French. The other students in my class are friendly. They are from all
around the world. At the weekend we are planning to go out together to watch a film.
See you soon,
Mark
