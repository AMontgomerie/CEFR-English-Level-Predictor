Would you like to go see a movie tomorrow night?
I am busy tomorrow night, but I am free the night after.
That's great! What time should I pick you up?
8 p.m. would be great.
Well, 8 p.m. it is. What movie would you like to see?
I'm not sure. Which movies are out right now?
I actually don't know. How about we choose when we get there?
Sure thing, that sounds great.
Okay, should I pick you up at your house? Or do you want to meet somewhere?
I live by school; if you want, we could meet there.
Sure. I drive a white Nissan Sentra. I'll text you later on, okay?
That sounds great. I'll be waiting for your text.
