I would like to see my counselor now.
Sorry, she doesn't have any time today.
Are you serious?
Yes, I am. Please make an appointment for next week.
I really need to see her.
I'm sorry, but you really can't.
I swear, I will bang on her door and scream.
Don't make a scene.
If you don't want me to make a scene, tell the counselor I'm here.
Fine! You can only talk to her for five minutes, though.
That's all I need.
Next time, you'd better make an appointment.
