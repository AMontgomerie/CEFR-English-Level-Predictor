I didn't like the way you sang tonight.
Oh, wow. Well, thanks for coming out.
You didn't put in all your effort. That's all I'm saying.
Okay, well I'm going to leave now.
Why are you in a rush to leave?
Because you are being rude, and I don't want to speak to you.
Well, now I know you can't take criticism.
It's not that I can't take criticism; it's that I don't like jerks.
How am I a jerk? I'm just giving you my honest opinion.
Well, in my honest opinion, I don't care what you think.
Now, that was rude. I don't want to talk to you anymore.
Great. Believe me; I won't be losing any sleep.
