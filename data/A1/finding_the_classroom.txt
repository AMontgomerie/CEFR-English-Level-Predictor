It takes me hours to find my classroom.
I might be able to help you.
Really? That would be great!
What's your classroom number?
My classroom number is A21.
So the "A" is the building type.
Okay, but I don't know where that is.
Do you know where the gym is?
Yeah, I do.
Okay, your classroom is behind the gym.
That's really helpful! Thank you.
No problem, and the "21" means it's upstairs.
