Thank you!!
Hi Carolina,
I just wanted to write and say thank you for everything.
You and your family were amazing hosts. I had a great time at your house. Thank you for making me feel at home. I'm sure my English improved a lot because of all your help too! Also, thank you for all the wonderful cooking you did. Now I can tell everyone English food is not as bad as they say .
If you ever come to Sri Lanka, I hope you will stay with me and I can show you my city too.
Keep in touch!.
Pradeep
