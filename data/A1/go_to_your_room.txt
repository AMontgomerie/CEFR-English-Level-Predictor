Alice told her son Jesse to go to his room. He didn't want to go to his room. "Why do I have to go to my room?" he said. "You were a bad boy," she said. "You hit your sister." He said, "No, I didn't. She hit me first." Alice said, "But you shouldn't hit your sister, even if she hits you first. She is younger than you are. And she's a little girl. Boys should never hit little girls." Jesse said, "Okay, I won't ever hit little girls again. Now do I have to go to my room?" Alice said yes, he still had to go to his room. "When she's a big girl, I'm going to hit her again," he said.
