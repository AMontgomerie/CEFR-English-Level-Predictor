Why is the printer line so long?
It's finals week.
Oh yeah, you're right.
This happens every year, so I got smarter.
What do you mean?
I printed my stuff for finals at home.
Oh, that is smart. I have to get in line now.
What do you have to print?
I have to print some notes.
Good luck. You'll be waiting here for a long time.
I bet the ink and paper will go out.
If that happens, you're in trouble.
