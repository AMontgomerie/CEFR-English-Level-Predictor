Jack paid $100,000 for his house. He had bought his house 30 years ago. It was a big house. It had four bedrooms. It had four bathrooms. Jack was alone. His wife had died. His children had moved out. His house was too big for one man. He decided to sell his house. He called up a real estate agent. She visited Jack. She looked at his house. She looked at all the rooms. She looked at the front yard. She looked at the back yard. She looked at the garage. "This is a beautiful house," she said. "I think this house will sell for $500,000." Jack said, "That's great. I will give $300,000 to my children. I will buy a small house for $200,000."
