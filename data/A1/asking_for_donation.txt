Would you like to donate money for Christopher?
Wait, what happened to Christopher?
He was hit by a car after school the other day.
What? That was terrible!
That day I was going to walk home with him, but I decided to go to the library.
I can't believe it. Is he okay?
He broke some bones, but other than that, he is okay.
Oh, great! So, why are you collecting money for him?
The hospital bills are sort of steep. His parents can't afford it.
Oh, wow! Well, here is my last $10. Please send my best to Chris.
Thank you. Every dollar counts.
Bless your heart for helping him out.
