How may I help you?
My computer is not letting me run JavaScript.
That can easily be fixed.
I've tried fixing it myself, but nothing worked.
If you'd kindly go to our website, I'll fix the problem.
I've logged in, now what?
I will now access your computer from my location.
Oh, I see what you are doing.
That should just about fix the problem!
Thank you so much! It was such an easy solution.
I'm happy to help.
Again, thank you and have a good day!
