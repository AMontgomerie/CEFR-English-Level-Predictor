Hello, how are you doing?
I am doing quite well, how are you?
I've been better. I'm completely swamped with work.
I know the feeling. My boss works me hard, too.
Enough about work. How are the kids?
They are good. The oldest is about to graduate from high school.
You're kidding me! That's great, man.
The youngest is about to start middle school soon.
My son is about to start middle school as well.
Hey, maybe they will be classmates.
It's a strong possibility.
Yeah. Well, I want to try and beat the traffic. Good-bye.
Have a good one.
