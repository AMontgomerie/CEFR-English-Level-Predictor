Everything is going wrong today.
Well, at least the weather is nice.
Oh, yeah. Imagine if it had rained like they said it would.
I know, I would have gotten soaked walking home.
Yeah, I love when the sun is shining, but it's not too hot.
I do, too. This weather is pretty sweet.
I guess everything will be okay in the end.
So all you needed was some sunshine.
Yeah, I guess you were right â€“ for once.
Hey! I'm always right.
