I can't spend anymore money after I buy my English textbook.
How much is your English textbook?
It's $198. I'm not kidding.
That's ridiculously expensive! What's the title of the textbook?
It's called How to Write Well.
Dude, someone is selling that book for $30.
No way. What edition is it?
I think it was the 10th edition.
Oh, no wonder he or she is selling it for only $30.
What edition do you need?
I need the 21st edition.
The publisher seems to be really making money, considering the number of editions.
