Miss, you have been using the computer for over an hour now.
I know, I'm sorry.
Are you looking for something?
I'm researching for my project.
Can you come back tomorrow? Your daily computer limit time is up.
I don't have a computer at home.
I'm sorry to hear that, but other people need to use the computer, too.
My project is due very soon. I need to research.
How about books? This is a library after all.
I looked for books on my project. They're not good at all.
Maybe you don't know how to look for good books. I'll help you.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
