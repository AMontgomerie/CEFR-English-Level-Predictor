You need to try harder in school!
I am doing well in school.
Then why are your marks in science so low?
I don't understand science, that's all.
Is that the same reasoning you have for math?
Yes, and English, too.
Tell me one single subject you're doing well in.
Well, I'm doing wonderfully in my music class.
What about history?
Only the parts about Woodstock.
That's it! You're grounded! No guitar for a month.
Great, now I'll surely have a low GPA.
