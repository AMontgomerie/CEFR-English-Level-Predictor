I have to go to bed early.
Why? The night is still young!
I have a class at 7 a.m.
That's tough! My earliest class is at 9 a.m.
That sounds amazing to me.
How do you stay awake in that class?
Before I go to class, I drink four cups of coffee and take a cold shower.
Interesting routine. Does it work?
Kind of. It's better than not doing it at all.
Why are you taking that class?
It's only offered once a year, so I have to take it now.
I hope the class is interesting, at least.
