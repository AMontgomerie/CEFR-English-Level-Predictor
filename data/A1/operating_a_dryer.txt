Put your wet clothes into the dryer, please!
How long should I put them in for?
Put them on low heat for thirty minutes.
Why low heat?
If the air is too hot, the clothes will shrink.
I need to wash another load of laundry.
If they're colored, wash them in cold water.
Does warm water make them fade?
Yes. Put the detergent here, and don't use bleach.
Oh, that's where to put the detergent.
Don't forget to add fabric softener after the first rinse.
Okay, I won't. Thanks.
