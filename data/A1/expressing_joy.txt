C'mon, guess what?
I don't know, chicken butt?
Stop playing games. I got the part in the school play!
Really? That's great!
All this practice is finally paying off.
Yes, it is. I can't believe it!
Same here. I'm going to be the main character!
I'm so proud of you. I can't wait to see the play.
It's going to be a lot of hard work, but I'm glad I got the part.
When does the play open?
It opens in three weeks.
Great. Get me a ticket. I want to be sitting in the front row.
