I heard that your brother is in the hospital.
Yeah. He's been there since last week.
Oh, no. What happened? Is he alright?
He got in a car accident. He should be alright.
The doctors told you he would be alright?
Yes, but they need to keep him for further tests.
Oh, okay. I was so worried when I heard this.
Thanks, but everything should be fine. He was lucky.
Really lucky. Did anyone else get injured?
His girlfriend broke her arm, but that's all.
Oh, that's not good. Is she at the hospital?
Yes, she is taking care of my brother.
