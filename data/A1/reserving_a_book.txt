I would like to reserve The Hunger Games.
Everyone wants to reserve that book these days.
It's really popular, because the movie just came out.
You have to pay $1 to reserve the book.
What?! That's ridiculous.
Like you said, it's popular.
I have to think about it then.
I personally think $1 is nothing. It's cheaper than buying the book.
How much is the book?
On the back, it says it's $15. It depends on the bookstore you go to though.
Fine, I'll give you a $1.
You won't regret it! The book is really good.
