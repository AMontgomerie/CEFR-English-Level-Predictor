He called up the post office. "Where is my package?" he asked. "What is the tracking number?" the postal worker asked. He told her the tracking number. She said, "Your package is at the main post office. You can pick it up anytime." He said, "I don't want to pick it up. Can you deliver it?" She said yes. "We will deliver it on Monday," she said. "Will you be home?" He said, "What time on Monday?" She said, "Anytime between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m." He said, "I have to work. I can't stay home all day." She said, "That's okay. We can deliver it on Tuesday." He said, "I have to work on Tuesday, too. Please deliver it on Saturday."
