I'm bored. Do you want to do something?
What did you have in mind?
Do you want to go drink?
No, I have work tomorrow, and I don't want to be hung over.
You don't have to get wasted.
I know you. You won't shut your mouth until I get wasted.
Fine. Let's go to the record store. I hear they have new vinyl.
I'm down to go to the record store. I haven't been there in a while.
Actually, I don't feel like going to the record store.
Well, what do you want to do?
Let's go to the movies instead?
Yeah, that new movie that I want to see is out. Let's go.
