Can you please shut up?
Maybe if you ask nicely, I will!
This is a library, so you have to shut up.
I didn't know laughing was a crime.
It's a crime in the library.
You're just jealous, because I'm having a good time, and you're not.
No, that's not it at all.
I'll shut up if you say you're sorry.
Sorry for what? If anything, you should say sorry.
Okay, fine. I'm sorry that your parents didn't teach you how to be nice.
That does it. I'm getting a librarian.
Go get one!
