You can't check out this one. It's a reference book.
What does that mean?
It means you can only read it in the library.
But I need it for my essay.
You can take pictures of the pages you need.
I need almost all of them.
You can keep coming back here.
That's so inconvenient.
It is, but they have to be kept here.
I guess I can take pictures of the pages then.
Sorry about the inconvenience.
It is okay. It's not your fault.
