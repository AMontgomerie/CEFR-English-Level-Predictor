Hi, I'm here to apply for a library card.
Is this your first time applying for one?
It's my first time applying for a card here.
Do you have cards with any other libraries?
Yes, I have one with my college and one with my local library.
What college do you go to?
UCLA. They have over 10 libraries!
That's one of the great perks of higher education.
Even though I have library cards, I really like this library.
What do you like about it?
I like the foreign language books. That's rare for any library.
Yes, it is! We get people all over the world because of that section.
