She was a nurse. It was flu season. But she didn't get a flu shot. All the other nurses got a flu shot. All the doctors got a flu shot. But she didn't get a flu shot. Flu shots made her sick. She got a flu shot when she was a little girl. The flu shot made her very sick. She spent a week in the hospital. Then she came home. She spent three weeks in bed. She was sick for about a month. After that, no more flu shots for her. She never got a flu shot again. She never got the flu, either. "I never get a flu shot, but I never get the flu," she told her friend.
