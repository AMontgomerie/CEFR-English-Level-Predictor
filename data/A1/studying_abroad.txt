I'm planning to study abroad this summer.
Cool! Where are you going?
I'm going to Italy.
What are you studying there?
I'm taking a cooking class.
That sounds interesting.
I'm excited to learn in a totally new environment.
Italy seems beautiful.
It's beautiful in the pictures I've seen.
Take a lot when you're there.
I will, and I'll study hard, too.
Also, learn some Italian while you're there.
