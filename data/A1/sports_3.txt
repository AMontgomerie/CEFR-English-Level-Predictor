Can you explain baseball to me?
I can try to explain the basics. What do you want to know?
What are strikes?
Every batter has three strikes. When they get three strikes, they are out.
Okay, but what about when the umpire calls a ball?
Once an umpire calls four balls, then the batter goes to first base.
What happens when a pitcher hits a batter with the ball?
The batter goes to first base.
What if someone is on first base?
Then whoever was on first base goes to second base.
Oh, okay. What's a no-hitter?
A no-hitter is when a team doesn't get a hit throughout the game.
So, that's a good thing for the pitcher?
Yes, because that means he pitched really well.
