I hate my roommate.
I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong with her?
A lot of things. First of all, she snores so loudly!
That's not really her fault. What else?
She never takes a shower.
That's disgusting! You should tell her to take a shower.
I did! She got mad at me and then proceeded to slap me.
Ouch! Did you try to get a new roommate?
I tried, but I could not. No one was willing to switch.
I guess you can get a new room by yourself.
I can't afford it. Ugh, I hate her so much.
It's okay. The year will be over before you know it.
