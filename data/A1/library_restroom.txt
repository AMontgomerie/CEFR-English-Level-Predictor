Do you have a restroom?
Only for employees.
But I really need to go.
I can't let you go. There's a restroom in the market across from us though.
That restroom is really dirty. It smells like someone died in there.
Fine, I'll take you to our restroom.
Yay! Thank you so much.
We have to go secretly. If anyone sees you use the restroom, I'll be fired.
Don't worry. I will be small and quiet as a mouse.
Okay, good. The password is 595. Go quickly before anyone sees you.
Thank you for your kindness.
You owe me if we ever see each other again.
