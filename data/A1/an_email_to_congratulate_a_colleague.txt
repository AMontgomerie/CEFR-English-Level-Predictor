Subject: Great presentation!
Hi Jon
I'm just writing to say well done on your presentation this morning. It was not an easy task and I'm glad it went well.
You were well prepared. The content was relevant and easy to follow. You also thought about the questions people would have. I think they were impressed! I'm sure everyone feels happier about the new system now.
If you have time, please could you listen to my presentation for next week?
See you later
Sue
