Did you hear about Joseph and Michelle?
No, what happened? Did they have a divorce?
Oh, no. They are pregnant.
Really? How far along is Michelle?
Joseph told me that she is four months.
Oh, okay. How is he handling the news?
He was a mess the last time I saw him.
How is he now? Is he still crazy?
Actually, he seems relaxed and collected.
I can't believe Joseph is going to be a father.
It's trippy, huh? He is our age.
This is making me feel really old.
