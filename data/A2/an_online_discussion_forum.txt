Can you believe it? Someone in another group asked me to write some pages of their website in English and French. But they can't pay because 'I'm starting this business with no money.' He said he's a professional photographer and he can do some photos for me instead. Am I wrong to be angry?
Asher87
Nope! I’d be angry too

I can't help but here's the link to a friend's website. He is a French–English writer and translator www.franco-anglo-translations.com/About

Er … asking people to work for free … not cool!
Asher87
^^^ This!
JayCee99
Oops! I thought you were looking for someone. Sorry for the misunderstanding smiley

I can't pay my rent with photographs, sorry
Katie20
Exactly!
Mylo45
True, but professional photos cost a lot of money, especially if you're getting married. Sorry I don't speak French or I would do it cheeky

Here's a link to his photography if anyone wants the job www.billsphoto.com/portfolio As you can see the website needs some work … wink

@Mylo45 Maybe, but people always ask writers to work for free #PayMe
Katie20
Yep, if I need photos OK but I prefer to get paid with money
