Do you have a car on campus?
No, because it's hard to find parking here.
How do you get to places then?
I walk or take the bus.
That's crazy! I could never do that.
You should. It's great for the environment.
That's true. What do you do for fun then?
There's a lot of stuff to do around campus.
I never realized.
You should do some exploring.
You convinced me. I won't bring my car this semester.
We can walk to places together now!
