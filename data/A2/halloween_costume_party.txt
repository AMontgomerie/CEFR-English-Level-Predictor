"Did you get your costume done last night?" I asked my girlfriend Audrey in the early morning of October 31. "Of course, it was ready, but you're not going to see it until tonight," she said. That was a real disappointment. I had been looking forward to seeing her latest Halloween creation. Audrey is a fine seamstress, and every year she makes the best costumes for the Halloween parties we try to attend. On the other hand, I usually just put some old rags on and go as a hobo or a pirate, or something lame like that, but not Audrey. She goes all out. Last year, she went as a beautiful witch complete with the pointy hat and witch's broom. She looked beautiful.
 
The Halloween tradition is very old in the United States. No one really knows how it was first celebrated, but it did come from somewhere in Europe. It was originally called "All Hallows Eve", and celebrated on last day of October. It precedes "All Hallows Day", which is a day to honor dead relatives. Today, it means parties for the adults and "Trick or treating" for the kids. "Trick or treating" is where kids also dress up in costumes and go door to door to get candy treats. It's a whole lot of fun.
Some people say Halloween is a Welsh, or Celtic tradition, while others say its roots are Christian, but it doesn't really matter anymore. We just like to get dressed up like fools, go to parties, and eat lots of candy! Audrey finally showed up at my door. She was strikingly beautiful. She was dressed as a fairy princess and was glowing in her white gown. "You look amazing," I told her. She just laughed and said, "I know," and tapped me with her wand.
