Riding the bus is as easy as pie. The bus driver is there to answer any questions passengers may have. And it only costs one dollar and fifty cents. These were the things Valery had heard from all her friends about public transportation. She had never ridden on the bus alone before. This was about to change in fifteen minutes as she stood waiting at the bus stop at the corner of Atlantic Avenue and 61th Street. Valery had just turned fifteen and was ready to start riding the bus on her own.
 
Valery's mom had sent her to Grandma's house for a weekend stay. She had packed all her belongings in a backpack, and was dressed in her lucky outfit in case she crossed any black cats. She was heading to the city of Montebello where her Grandmother lived. Her heart began racing when she saw the number 260 bus approaching in the distance. She looked around to see if she was alone, but there wasn't anyone else waiting for the bus. She was all alone.
"Come on, you can do this," Valery said to herself. She remembered she and her mother had taken the same bus to her Grandma's house the dozens of times. "It's just like before, except mom is not here," Valery said, trying to ease herself. The bus finally came to a halt at its stop, and its doors opened in front of Valery. She took a deep breath, looked at the bus driver, and stepped inside.
Valery put the money into the slot and greeted the bus driver. She then proceeded to the back of the bus and quickly sat down next to an elderly woman. The scariest part was over. "Now all I have to do is sit and wait until I reached my destination," said Valery to herself. "Don't forget to pull the cord," a familiar voice said in her head.
