Michael Hall always loved playing basketball with his brother Scott. They lived next to a park, and they went to play basketball at the park every day. Michael was a junior at his college, and Scott was a freshman. They both tried out for the college team, but were so nervous during the tryouts that they didn't make it. One day, while they were playing basketball, Michael noticed that a guy was watching them play. When Michael and Scott finished playing, the guy who was watching them went up to Michael.
 
"You guys have some skills," the guy said. Michael finally realized who the man was. It was Charles King, a famous basketball player. Charles told them that he used to play basketball at that park too when he was younger. Charles asked them if they played for school, or if they had a team with friends. They said they didn't make it into their school's team. "I never made it into my school's basketball team either," Charles said.
Charles asked the brothers if they wanted to play a game of 2 on 1, they happily said yes. Charles won, of course, but he told the brothers that they were really good. Charles then told the brothers that he was starting a basketball camp at his old high school, and if they were interested; they could join it for free. The brothers had heard about it, and said that they would love to join. "We just have to ask our mother," Scott said. Charles laughed, and said, "Of course, you don't want to get mom mad." The two brothers ran back home, and they told their mom about what had happened at the park. She told them that they could join as long as they kept up with their homework and their classes. The brothers agreed, and went back to the park to practice.
