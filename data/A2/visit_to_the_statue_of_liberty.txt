It has always been a dream of mine to visit New York. My parents always talked about going to New York, but we never went. I loved a lot of things about New York, but one thing that I really wanted to see was the Statue of Liberty. My parents aren't from the United States, but I was born here. They saw the Statue of Liberty as something more, not just as something people wanted to go see and take pictures of.
 
My parents never saw the Statue of Liberty because we lived in Texas. They crossed the border, and longed to see the Statue of Liberty with their own eyes, but never got the chance. I decided that I was going to fulfill their dream. I finally saved enough money for a plane ticket, and went to stay with a friend that I had met at home but now in New York. We talked over the Internet, and she told me that if I ever got the chance to go to New York, I could stay with her. I called her the day I got my plane ticket.
"Guess who's going to New York," I said. She started yelling and saying that it was going to be a lot of fun. I told her that my first stop had to be the Statue of Liberty. She told me that she couldn't wait. When I got out of the plane, I couldn't believe how cold it was. I got my luggage and met my friend outside of the airport. I hugged her and we got a taxi to take us to her home.
When we got to her house, she showed me her room and told me we would be leaving for the Statue of Liberty in an hour. I took a shower and put on two sweaters. We got a taxi, and went to see the Statue of Liberty. It took a while, but we finally got to the island. I couldn't believe the Statue of Liberty was right before my eyes. I started crying, and felt my parents were right here with me. I always felt like a foreigner in this country even though I was born here. Now I understood why they wanted to visit the Statue of Liberty so much.
