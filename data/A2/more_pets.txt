It was four o'clock when Jenny and her dad arrived at the pet shop on Slauson Avenue. The name of the pet shop was Pet Wonders. Jenny couldn't maintain her excitement and yipped as she and her dad exited the car. Jenny's dad smiled at the sight of her thrilled daughter. He remembered his own first pet. It was a Chihuahua named Taco. He wondered if Pet Wonders was selling any Chihuahuas.
 
Jenny and her dad were greeted by a short and balding man, who smelled like dog food. "Hello, how can I help you guys today?" the man said. "We're here to buy a pony!" Jenny exclaimed to the man. "Actually, we're here to browse," Jenny's dad said right after. "Let me know when you're ready to make a purchase," the man replied. Jenny and her dad proceeded to look through the aisles.
"What do you think of these, Jenny?" asked her dad. "They're too small," she said. Jenny saw a variety of colorful fishes. "What about these, Jenny?" her dad asked. "They're too slimy," said Jenny. Jenny came across snakes and turtles. "Would you like one of these?" asked her dad. "I don't think so," Jenny responded. One hour passed and Jenny still had not made up her mind on which animal to choose.
Jenny and her dad finally got around to see the cats and dogs. "It's either one or the other," Jenny's dad said, pointing to the cats and dogs. Jenny had to think long and hard on which pet to get. After what seemed like an eternity, Jenny looked up at her dad and said, "I can't choose one". Her dad paused for a minute, smiled and said to her, "Then choose two". Jenny went home with a white cat and a black dog, which were the best birthday present she had ever received.
