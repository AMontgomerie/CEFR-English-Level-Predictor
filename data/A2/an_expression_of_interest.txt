Dear Sir/Madam,
I'm writing to express my interest in the summer travel grant that was advertised in this month's university magazine.
I am a second-year student and I am planning to study English in New York for three weeks in July. I would like to apply for the travel grant to help me with my expenses.
Could you please send me further details, including how to apply and when the application deadline is?
I look forward to hearing from you.
Regards,
Merry
