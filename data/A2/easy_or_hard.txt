I don't know which class to register for.
You should pick the class you need.
I know I need a science class.
I would take biology with Mr. Green.
It's a challenging yet fun class.
I don't like challenges.
Why are you in college then?
My mom forced me to enroll.
You should go to a vocational school instead.
I don't think you understand. My mom is scary.
Okay, fine. I recommend Earth Science 125 with Mr. Anderson.
Thanks for the recommendation!
