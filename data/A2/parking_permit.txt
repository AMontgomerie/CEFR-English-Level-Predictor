The parking permit is $200 per semester, right?
It's actually $300.
Why?! That's ridiculous.
It's because of the budget cuts.
That's a terrible excuse.
It's the truth.
Give me something better than that.
Miss, if you don't want to pay, then don't.
This is so stressful.
I advise writing a letter to the dean.
I bet he'll just throw it away.
You would be surprised.
