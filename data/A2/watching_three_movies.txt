Betty Gonzalez likes going to the movies. She likes to wait until there are multiple movies she wants to see. She'll usually go early in the day in order to see at least two movies. Betty is proud that her record is seeing four movies in one day. She usually sneaks in snacks to eat at the movie theater. Betty doesn't care if no one wants to go with her; she'll go alone and have fun.
 
It was Saturday morning. Betty saw that there were three movies she wanted to see showing at the theater. Betty got her purse and made herself two sandwiches, bought a soda, got her sweater, and went to the movies. After she had seen two of the movies, she bought a soda and was going to sneak into the next movie. As Betty walked up to the room where the movie was showing, she noticed that a man was checking for tickets. Betty began to get nervous.
Betty didn't have a ticket, but she really wanted to see this movie. She did not like the other two movies; she knew she was going to like this one, because her favorite actor was in it. The man that was checking for tickets stopped Betty as she tried to pass him. He asked her for her ticket. Betty didn't know what to do. The man was speaking in English, so Betty decided to speak in Spanish.
She told the man something in Spanish, and then walked off while she was still talking. The man was confused, and he didn't know what to do. Betty looked like she was mad at the man, so he didn't want to do anything else to get her even angrier. He just let her go through. When Betty got to her seat, her heart was still beating fast. She started laughing. She took a sip of soda and watched the movie in peace.
