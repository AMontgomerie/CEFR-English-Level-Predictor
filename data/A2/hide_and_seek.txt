One of the best games children play in America is Hide and Seek. You didn't need anything to play, and you could play for hours without getting bored. Another great thing about Hide and Seek is that anyone could play, boys, girls, young, and old. Hide and Seek was great. All you needed was a little imagination and a sense of adventure.
 
The way the game is played is simple. I remember the first time I played. I came up to some of my brother's friends who were playing in the neighborhood. "Hey, what are you guys playing?" I asked. "We are playing Hide and Seek," said Robert, my brother's best friend. "Can I play?" I asked, even though I didn't really know the rules. After a while, the boys let me play. The object of the game is to hide from one of the players. This person closes his eyes and counts to 10 out loud to start the game. While he or she is counting, the rest of the kids run to find a hiding place.
Hiding places can be anywhere. Behind cars, or in the bushes, just about anywhere! It was Robert's turn. When he had counted 10, he yelled, "Ready or not, here I come!" Whoever is the first person found becomes "It", and it's their turn to count. I thought I had the best hiding place ever. I was in the bushes near my house. I could see through the leaves everything Robert was doing, and I knew he was getting close to finding David, another one of my friends.
I was overjoyed that I wasn't going to be the first one found. I had proven myself to everybody who said I was too young to play when all of a sudden, a mouse ran over my foot! I jumped and screamed out of the bushes, and was the first one found. The next thing I knew, I was counting out loud and trying to find my friends.
