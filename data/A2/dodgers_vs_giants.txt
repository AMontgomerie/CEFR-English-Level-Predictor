One of the greatest American traditions is the game of baseball. Living in Los Angeles has given me the chance to watch one of the oldest baseball teams in the history of the game -- the Dodgers. The team came into existence in New York City in the 1880s, when they were known by several names. Until 1956, the Dodgers played in Brooklyn New York, but in 1957, the team moved west to Los Angeles, and it has played there ever since.
 
I recently asked my wife Josie if she wanted to go to a game one night, and of course she said yes. "Why wouldn't I want to go? The weather is great and the stadium is beautiful. Besides, I think we need a break in our routine," she said. "You're absolutely right, baby. Let's go!" I said.
We were off to Dodger Stadium, which is nestled in the hills just north of downtown L.A. in a neighborhood called Chavez Ravine. Even though it is the third oldest stadium in the country, it is still beautiful. "Wow. This place never gets old," I said as we got to our seats. Josie agreed. It was a perfect night for a ball game. The temperature was in the low 70s, and it was a clear, breezy night.
The Dodgers were playing the Giants that night. The two teams have been playing each other for about 100 years, ever since both teams were in New York. The Giants moved the same year the Dodgers did. only they moved up north to San Francisco. That didn't stop the rivalry though. The teams hate each other today as much as they did back in New York. The best part of the night was that the Dodgers won, so I had a couple of Dodger Dogs. "I don't know what they do to these hot dogs, but they are delicious," I told Josie. She wiped some mustard off her face and said, "Absolutely!"
