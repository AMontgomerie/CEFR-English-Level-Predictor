Hi Samia,
Just a quick email to say that sounds like a great idea. Saturday is better for me because I'm meeting my parents on Sunday. So if that's still good for you, why don't you come here? Then you can see the new flat and all the work we've done on the kitchen since we moved in. We can eat at home and then go for a walk in the afternoon. It's going to be so good to catch up finally. I want to hear all about your new job!
Our address is 52 Charles Road, but it's a bit difficult to find because the house numbers are really strange here. If you turn left at the post office and keep going past the big white house on Charles Road, there's a small side street behind it with the houses 50â€“56 in. Don't ask me why the side street doesn't have a different name! But call me if you get lost and I'll come and get you.
Let me know if there's anything you do/don't like to eat. Really looking forward to seeing you!
See you soon!
Gregor
