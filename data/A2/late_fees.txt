I'm sorry, but you can't borrow this book.
What do you mean?
You have not paid your late fees for your overdue books.
I never had any overdue books!
The computer doesn't lie.
What books do I have late fees for?
They're all math books, and according to the system, you still have them.
Oh yeah, I do! I totally forgot about them and left them on my bed.
Once you return them and pay the fee, you can borrow books again.
But I really need to borrow those books now.
I can put them on hold for you.
Yes! You are the best.
