Hey, are you free on Saturday? Do you want to do something?
I'm busy on Saturday, but how about Sunday?
Sure! Sunday works for me
What are you thinking?
How about a drive out to the beach? I've got the car this weekend because Mike is away.
Sounds good! What time?
I can pick you up from your place about 9 if you like
I'm going to the gym first thing in the morning
Shall we meet a bit later, say 10?
Perfect! Do you fancy a picnic? I can go shopping while you're at the gym
Great! Even better! See you tomorrow!
