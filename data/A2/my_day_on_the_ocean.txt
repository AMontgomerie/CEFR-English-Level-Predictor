Last week Chris went on her first deep sea fishing trip off the coast of Catalina Island. She had always enjoyed fishing when she was a child, but had never gone fishing in the ocean. Her dad liked to fish very often. Her big brother Jack was never the outdoor type, so her dad took her out often. One of his favorite spots was Lake Isabella, which was about two hours from their home. She recalls how she and her dad would spend a long, leisurely day driving to the lake, and then taking his small boat out on the water. It was quiet and peaceful for the most part. Those memories remain some of her most cherished moments of her life.
 
Chris has a friend called Robert. On this day, Robert invited Chris to join him on his company's fishing trip. Robert said it wouldn't cost much, but would be a lot of fun. He knew Chris enjoyed lake fishing and figured she would have a great time. "Okay," said Chris, and to the ocean they went.
The first thing Chris noticed, however, was the motion. "Wow, this boat really rocks," Chris told Robert. "Don't worry about it. You will get used to it," he said. The trip to the waters off Catalina Island took about an hour. Chris marveled at how quickly she lost sight of the mainland. It was a bit scary when she thought about how alone they were in this great ocean.  Soon, it was time to collect squid for bait. The small boat stopped in the water, and the crew turned the bright light into the ocean to attract the squid. Before long, thousands of squid rose to the surface and were collected for bait.
After about an hour, Chris didn't feel the rocking motion anymore. They were ready to fish. Chris caught her first ocean trout. It was a beautiful day.
