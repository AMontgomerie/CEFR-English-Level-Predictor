Want to go to the writing workshop with me today?
Nah man, my writing skills is tight.
You mean "are" instead of "is," right?
Yeah, of course!
You should come with me. Our college has great workshops.
I don't want to look stupid.
You won't. You look stupid using incorrect grammar.
Fine. How long is the workshop?
It's about an hour.
I don't think my attention span is more than 5 minutes.
Don't worry, I'll pinch you to wake you up.
That's a clever idea.
