Hello, is this the Smith residence?
Yes it is, may I ask who is calling?
This is your bank calling in regards to an overcharge on your credit card.
I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.
It says here that you charged over $500 on it yesterday.
That can't be right; I have not used it in months!
Are you saying you did not make that charge?
That's exactly what I am saying.
Looking closer, this charge was made in a different city.
I am looking for my card now and I cannot find it.
This calls for further investigation.
I assure you I did not make the purchase.
