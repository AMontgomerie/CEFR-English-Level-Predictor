What have you done to my hair?
I did exactly what you told me to do.
I asked for a light trim, not for a butchering!
I had to cut out all the split ends.
I look like a grapefruit! My head is too round!
It's a short bob, very stylish.
It looks more like a bowl cut to me!
It looks fantastic, don't exaggerate.
I hate it! I'm not paying for this!
You have to pay me for my labor!
I'm never coming here ever again!
Trust me, you won't be missed.
