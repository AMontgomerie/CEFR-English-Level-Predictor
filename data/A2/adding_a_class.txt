I'm thinking of adding another class.
Another one? You already have 7 classes.
I know, but I really want to add Psychology 101. It seems interesting.
You're going to be so stressed out.
I think I can handle 8 classes.
Seriously? You're going to be constantly in class or studying.
I know, but it's worth it.
Tell me that when I'm partying and you're not.
How many classes are you taking? Two?
Haha! You're funny. I'm taking three.
That's so little. Don't you feel like an underachiever?
Remind me again why we're friends.
