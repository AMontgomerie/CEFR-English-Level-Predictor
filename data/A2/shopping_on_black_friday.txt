Janice was one of those people that loved getting up early for the Black Friday sales stores have after Thanksgiving Day. She loved going to her favorite stores to see what she could get on sale. A friend told her that her favorite store was going to have an amazing sale. They were going to sell an 60-inch television for $300. Janice wanted to make sure she was there early. She went to the store during the night and set up a tent to sleep over night.
 
Janice noticed that no one else had showed up when she was getting her tent ready, but she didn't care. She loved being there. She was so excited about the sales that she couldn't get any sleep. At around 3:30 a.m. she finally fell asleep. She set the alarm on her phone to wake her up at 6 a.m., but because she left her music playing when she fell asleep, her phone ran out of battery.
At around 8 a.m. a man who worked at the store came out and woke Janice up. She was surprised and asked him what time it was. He said it was 8 a.m. and she couldn't believe it. She went into the store and left her tent behind. She wanted to see if they still had the televisions. Janice saw that they didn't. People started looking at her, because her hair was a mess. She felt embarrassed and went back to get her stuff.
While she was going back home, she noticed another store that was open. She decided to go in, and was surprised to see that they had the television she wanted. It was $500, instead of $300. She bought the television and asked one of the workers if they could take it out to her truck. She went home and asked her brother to help her move the television. Once she got the television into her home, she climbed into bed and fell asleep.
