Hello, is this the Smith residence?
Hello, how can I help you today?
I am very upset with the quality of your service.
I'm sorry, what seems to be the problem?
My Internet service did not work for three days.
My records say a technician visited your area yesterday?
Yes, he installed a new modem.
Did it solve the problem?
Yes, but I was overcharged for Internet service.
Sorry about that. I'll give you credit for the three days.
I was sold a wireless service unavailable in my area.
I see it here; we charged you $5 extra a month.
Yes. Kindly return my money, please.
