I have a 89.5%.
Okay, so what?
It's really close to an A.
You know I don't round up.
But I really need a 4.0 GPA.
You get what you deserve.
I know I deserve an A. I always do great work and participate.
I can't change it.
Please? I'll wash your car.
Are you bribing me?
I just want an A.
I'll give you a C if you don't leave now.
