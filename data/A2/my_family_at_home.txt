My family lives in a small house. It’s simple but pretty. It has a large garden. I like to work in the garden but my sister hates to work in the garden. She prefers to read. She reads in the morning, in the afternoon and at night.
I give all of the vegetables to mom and dad. They like to cook in our small kitchen. I eat any vegetable but my sister eats only a few.
My family always eats breakfast and dinner together. We talk. We laugh. Then my sister washes the dishes.
At night dad likes to listen to music. Mom works on the computer. I watch television. And my sister reads.
Soon we go to bed. My parents go to bed late but my sister and I go to bed early. I’m ready to go to sleep but my sister wants to keep reading.
