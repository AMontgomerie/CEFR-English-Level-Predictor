I hate Professor Hernandez!
Me too! He keeps calling me stupid!
You think that's bad? He gave me an F, because I double spaced my essay!
But every professor wants essays double spaced. He's crazy!
Professor Hernandez is weird. He wants essays triple spaced.
That's just a waste of paper. Why does he like triple spacing?
He says it's because he has to make a lot of corrections, because we're stupid.
We should start a petition, and get him fired!
We should, but he can find out.
I know. If he found out, he would ruin everyone's life.
He is so evil.
That's why this petition has to work!
