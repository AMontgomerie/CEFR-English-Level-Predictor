Karen and Jack had been trying to have a child for many years with no success. All that changed one day, when they received the greatest gift in the world. That day, nearly one year ago, they had a healthy baby girl. They named her Julie, and it was the happiest day of their lives.
 
Karen loves to dress Julie up in pretty pastel colors complete with bows and ribbons. Karen thinks she's the most beautiful girl in the world. The other day, the small family went shopping, and all of a sudden, Karen let out a loud scream! "Oh, my god!" Jack ran over thinking something had gone wrong. "What's the matter?" he asked. "Nothing, she answered. "Look at this adorable outfit. It's perfect for little Julie," she said. Jack got a little upset about this. He was running toward Karen thinking she had fallen or that something had happened to Julie, but all that happened is that she found a pretty blue dress for their baby girl.
Shopping malls in the United States are all over the country. Some are very large, but most of them have anywhere between 50 to 100 shops each. They are places people go to eat and shop, or go to see a movie, or just hang out with friends. American teenagers love these places, especially in Los Angeles, when it gets very warm. The kids go there to cool off. It was no surprise Karen wanted to go there to buy little Julie her dress. If shoppers don't find what they are looking for in one shop, there's always another one close by at a shopping mall.
Karen kept talking about how perfect the outfit she found was and that she "absolutely had to find the right shoes to go with it. Of course she did find those shoes, and that made her very happy, and Jack too. Julie is going to look so pretty in her new outfit.
