"My dad's taking us to Santa Monica today," said Carol. "Do you want to go with us?" Laura loved to go to the beach, so she said she would be happy to. Santa Monica beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in California. There are more scenic views on the coastline up and down the state, but many are inaccessible to beachgoers. Santa Monica has a very large beach area that features white sand and lots of room to play. Carol liked to toss a Frisbee around with her friends and to play volleyball.
 
"Do you want to play volleyball, Laura," Carol asked when they got there. "Sure," said Laura, "but who are we going to play with? It takes more than two people to play." Carol thought about it, and said that they should start playing and others will join in, so the two girls started playing alone. Just as Carol said, more kids came over and wanted to play with them. Soon they had more than enough people for a game, and they played for hours.
After the game, the girls wanted to cool off, so they decided to jump into the ocean for a little relief. The water was crowded, but that just added to the fun. It was cool and wet, and the waves were just right. Some people were surfing both on surfboards and body boards, while others were swimming out to the buoys. On the coastline, two girls were digging for sea shells and one man was using his metal detector to find hidden treasure. Carol ran up to the man and asked him what he was looking for. He said: "Anything I can find, young lady.' Carol laughed and asked him if she could try. "Sure. Why not?" said the man. So Carol started scanning the beach and soon found a necklace, whcih the man let her keep. "Why not," said the man. "You found it." Carol was very happy and ran to tell Laura.
