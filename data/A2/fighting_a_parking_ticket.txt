You know you can't park here, right?
Listen, I had to talk to my friend really quickly, and there was no parking spaces.
I'm going to have to give you a ticket.
I'm a broke college student.
And I'm a broke police officer. Deal with it.
Can't you just let me off with a warning?
No way. I have to be firm with you.
I'll buy you a box of donuts.
You have got to be kidding me.
I thought all cops liked donuts.
That's a stereotype. You should really learn to be quiet.
I'll stay quiet if you let me off with a warning.
