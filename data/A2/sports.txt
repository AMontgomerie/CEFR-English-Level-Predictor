I'm thinking of joining a sports club on campus.
You should! It takes away the stress of studying.
What sport do you play?
I actually play on our university's baseball team.
That's cool! You must be really good.
Yeah, I have a baseball scholarship.
No wonder you're in such great shape!
You'll be in great shape too after joining a sports club.
I'm thinking of joining the tennis club.
I wouldn't if I were you. The members don't even play tennis.
What do they do then?
They just talk about tennis. They never even touched a racket, though.
