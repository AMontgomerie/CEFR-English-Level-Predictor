Quick! Get in here and wait out the storm!
Oh, my word. Thank you so much.
It's raining cats and dogs out there.
More like lions and wolves!
I was watching the news.
What did they say?
This is going to be one heck of a storm.
Should we be worried?
I don't think so. The emergency alert system would have gone up.
True. Well, thank you for saving me from this storm.
No problem. I'm making some tea; would you like some?
Please. Something warm would be great at the moment!
