Wow! Your books are over the due date by one month.
It would have been longer if there wasn't a hold on my record.
What kind of hold is on your record?
A hold that won't let me go to the college football game.
Oh, that's tough.
Yeah. My girlfriend is actually a cheerleader, and so I have to go.
You're not going to like what I'm going to say.
What is it?
I can't remove the hold even if you pay the overdue fee.
Is it a technical error?
I don't know! I just can't remove it!
If my girlfriend breaks up with me, I'm blaming you.
