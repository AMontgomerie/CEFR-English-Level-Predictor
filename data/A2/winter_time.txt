Winter was approaching. Jason was excited for the coming season. It was his favorite time of a year. He loved the cold weather and snow. Jason lived in New York. During winter it would snow in New York. He always played in the snow, even as an adult. Jason would gather his family and friends at the park, where they had snowball fights. It was a lot of fun.
 
His favorite holiday Christmas occurred in winter. This was another reason why winter was Jason's favorite season. Every year, he bought presents for his friends and family. Jason loved seeing the look on their faces when they unwrapped their Christmas presents. It was better to give than to receive, Jason thought. Jason loved everything about Christmas. He enjoyed caroling. He loved singing Christmas music. He loved kissing his wife under the mistletoe. He loved drinking sweet eggnog. Jason sometimes even dressed up as Santa Claus for fun, and entertained his nephews.
Winter also came at the end of a year. New Year's Day would come after Christmas. Jason also loved this holiday. It was a day to celebrate the new year to come, while reflecting on the past one. Jason always made New Year's resolutions. Every year he made a new resolution. This year he promised to go skydiving. Last year, he promised himself to lose twenty pounds. Jason always kept his New Year's resolution. He lost twenty pounds in three months. This year was no exception. He planned to sign up for skydiving lessons in January of next year.
Jason could not stop thinking about winter. He could not wait for it to come. It was going to be the best winter yet. Jason needed to wait five more months because it was barely mid July.
