I gained so much weight because my college dining hall is all-you-can-eat.
It's called the "freshman 15."
What is that exactly?
It's an expression to refer to the observation that many college freshmen gain weight.
Oh, I see. I definitely got the freshman 15 then.
You should use your college's gym.
I never have time.
Oh, please! You just have to make time.
I guess I should set an hour to work out.
That's the attitude I like to hear!
Did you gain any weight?
Yeah, I just wear big clothes to hide my fat.
