Hey, Professor Hill.
What is it?
I've been having trouble with derivatives.
That's not good. There's a test on derivatives next week.
I know. Can I make an appointment with you for some help?
I'm a busy man.
You didn't even check your schedule yet!
I know I'm busy, because many people already made appointments.
So I'm hopeless?
Of course not! There's the tutoring center.
But the tutors are not professors. They're just students.
They might surprise you.
