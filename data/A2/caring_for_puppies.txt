I think these puppies are hungry!
They've done nothing but play all day.
Do you think they're old enough to eat kibble?
They're six weeks old; I think they're old enough.
Look! They're digging right in!
Now they're settling for a nap.
Between keeping them from chewing things and cleaning, they're a hassle.
Yeah, they are. But look how cute they are while asleep!
Suddenly, I don't mind the chores so much.
Yeah, neither do I.
These puppies are truly worth it.
I wouldn't lose a single minute with them.
