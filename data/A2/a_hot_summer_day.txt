One hot summer day, Jay and his friends were playing outside. The sun shined down on Jay and his friends as they kicked a soccer ball back and fourth. Soccer was Jay's favorite sport to play. Almost every day Jay would invite his friends from his neighborhood to come out and play soccer in the street. Jay dreamed of one day being a professional soccer player. He imagined shooting a goal and hearing the roar of thousands of people as they cheered his name throughout the soccer stadium. Jay knew it would require a lot of practice if he wished to make his dream a reality.
 
One day, as the sun was beaming down on the street where Jay and his friends played earlier, an ice-cream truck approached. As soon as Jay heard the ice-cream truck's music playing, he ran outside his house with two dollars in his hand. Jay looked around to see where the ice-cream truck was. As soon as he spotted it down the street he bolted towards it. Jay's friends had arrived first and were already asking the ice-cream man for a cone of their favorite flavor of ice-cream. This gave Jay time to think about what flavor to get. "Should I get chocolate or vanilla?" Jay asked himself. "What's it going to be, son?" the ice-cream man asked Jay when he noticed he was the last kid standing without an ice-cream cone. "I'll have Pistachio, please," Jay responded after some hesitation.
This summer had turned out to be the best so far for Jay. Tomorrow he would play soccer once more, and if the ice-cream truck came around, he would ask his parents for another two dollars. Jay was not looking forward to starting his school year in two weeks.
