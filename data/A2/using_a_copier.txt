How much do I need to insert here to make one copy?
It depends. Do you want your copy in color or black and white?
I want it in color.
Then it will be 20 cents per page.
That's kind of expensive.
Yeah, but most of us don't have a copy machine of our own.
I have one, but it's broken.
That sucks. Well, if money's an issue, you can copy your stuff in black and white.
No, it has to be color.
Do you really not have 20 cents?
I do, but I'm really cheap.
Well, you don't really have a choice at this point.
