1. Last Saturday morning I had a strange experience.
7 . I got up and prepared my breakfast – the usual eggs and bread with coffee.
3 . Then, when I sat in the garden to eat, I noticed two enormous brown eyes looking at me.
5 . They belonged to a large white dog I had never seen before.
4 . Feeling frightened, I tried to smile and said ‘Hello boy’.
6. The dog heard this and jumped onto the chair next to me, smelt my eggs and started to eat.
2. Deciding to forget my breakfast, I watched it eat everything while I quietly drank my coffee.
