Kim was a housekeeper for a family in Beverly Hills. One morning when she went to work, she found a note from her boss. The note asked her to go to the supermarket and pick up a few things. There was a list of things Kim was supposed to buy. The note surprised Kim. She had only been a housekeeper for a week and had never been asked to go shopping before. Kim didn't even know where the nearest grocery store was. She also didn't know how to drive. Thankfully the note also told her that the boss's driver would take her to the market. There was also a $50 bill.
 
Once at the market Kim walked through looking for the items on her list. She was confused though. The list read "one pound of apples". Kim had purchased one kilogram of apples but never a pound. In her country, they used the metric system. She wasn't sure if a pound was more or less than a kilogram. Kim decided to ask one of the grocery workers. The grocery worker was kind and explained that a pound was about half a kilogram.
"I wouldn't worry about it though. Just use the scale," the grocery worker. Kim went to the scale and was happy to see that the scales didn't use the metric system she was used to. Kim weighed a pound of apples and put it in the shopping cart.
The next item on the list was a gallon of milk. Kim wasn't sure how much a gallon was. She was used to buying a liter of milk. There was also no way to weigh a liter of milk. She was glad that the milk containers were labeled. She just wished the U.S. used the metric system.
