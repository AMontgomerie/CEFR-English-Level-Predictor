Helen turned on her flashlight. Nothing happened. The light did not come on. There was no light. What was wrong with her flashlight? She unscrewed the top of the plastic flashlight. Helen took the two batteries out of the plastic tube. She looked at the two batteries. They were "D" batteries. They looked okay. They did not look bad. But maybe they were dead batteries. She opened a package of new batteries. She put two new "D" batteries into the plastic tube. Helen screwed the top back onto the plastic flashlight. She turned on her flashlight. The light worked!
