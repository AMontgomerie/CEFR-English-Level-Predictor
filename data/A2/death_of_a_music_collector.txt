It was a stupid mistake. Before I tell you about my mistake, I have to tell you about my father. My father Joseph Thomas was a big name in the music business. He managed a lot of different rock bands in the '60s. By the end of his career, he had saved up some money and decided to buy himself a cabin in a little town in Oregon. He didn't want to live in Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, or any other big cities. He wanted to escape the big city life.
 
My father died in that cabin three years ago. I found out about his life in the cabin a week after he died. He never really liked to answer his cell phone. It would always be on low battery, or off. He never bothered to charge it. He simply liked listening to his records and drinking whiskey.
During his time in the music industry, my father had collected various objects. He had different items from different artists. He had one of Jimi Hendrix's guitars, and a medallion that Janis Joplin had given him. Did I know this? No, I didn't. My dad always kept to himself. He was out on the road a lot, and he never really cared about keeping in touch with his kids. So, when he died, I figured all of his stuff at the cabin would be garbage. I told the town's Sheriff to throw everything out. I also told him to send me the paperwork for the cabin. I read about the discovery they made in my father's cabin. I couldn't believe it! Hendrix's guitar sold for over a million dollars, and so did the medallion. As I had already asked the Shariff to throw out everything as garbage, I wasn't entitled to anything, which probably made my father happy.
