I'm glad you came to talk to me today.
You kind of forced me to.
That's because I'm worried.
What are you worried about?
You withdrew from 4 of your 5 classes last semester.
I was doing poorly!
And why was that exactly?
It was just too hard.
You're really behind now. You might have to spend 6 years here.
Can't I just take summer classes?
Yes, but you don't want to stress yourself out.
I don't really have a choice.
