I'm so frustrated. I can't find any books on my research topic at my library.
Why don't you try a different library?
I don't want to waste gas money.
But you might find your book.
What library do you suggest?
I suggest the one near my house.
That is way too far for me.
They have a lot of books. That library has never disappointed me.
I have an idea! Why don't you borrow them for me?
I don't know about that. What if you lose the books?
I won't. I swear on my life.
Wow, you're so serious.
