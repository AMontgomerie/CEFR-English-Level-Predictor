 
George had always been a funny guy. I met him at the movie theater. I went to see the new Spider-Man movie, and he was there dressed up like Spider-Man. He was acting like Spider-Man, and everyone was clapping for him and asking him for pictures. My girlfriend wanted to go take her picture with him, and I said okay. When I went up to him, I asked him if it was okay to take a picture of him and my girlfriend. He said yes.
 
I took the picture and started talking to him. He told me that his friends hadn't showed up yet, and that he didn't want to sit alone. My girlfriend and I decided to sit with him. After we saw the movie, I asked him if he wanted to go grab a bite to eat. He accepted my invitation. He had me and my girlfriend laughing the whole drive to the restaurant. We talked a lot on the phone. We were big fan of Nintendo games. I invited him over to my house so we could play.
George never had a bad thing to say about anyone. He told me once that there is good in everyone, some are just afraid to show it. George had invited me to his house one day to play old Nintendo games, but when I showed up to his house, no one was there. I looked around and called him on his cell phone, but no one answered. I decided to leave and come back in an hour.
When I got back to George's house, I saw that someone was inside. I knocked on the door, and an older woman came out. It was George's aunt. I asked her if George was home, she looked at me with sad eyes and said that George was in the hospital. I finally understood why George was the way he was. George had cancer, and the doctors told him that he could go at any time. That's why George was always looking for the humor in life, because his real life was filled with sadness.
