My first road trip was horrible. When I turned 24 years old, my father lent me his car to go from Los Angeles to Chicago. I told my dad that my friend George was going with me, and he was bringing his girlfriend Nancy. My dad liked that George was going, because he was a responsible young adult, which made me think that my dad doesn't think of me as an adult. When the day we were scheduled to leave arrived, George's girlfriend didn't arrive at my house until 5 p.m. when we agreed we would meet at 2 p.m.
 
It wasn't bad. I had been waiting for this road trip for a year. I could wait a little longer. When Nancy arrived, we packed up her suitcase and hit the road. I was friends with both of them, but George was my friend first. I started getting annoyed with them right away. Even though I had my music playing in the car, I could still hear them in the back kissing and calling each other baby, sweetie, sweetheart, and other nauseating cute names. I didn't like it, but what was I going to do?
George took over the wheel after we left California. He was talking to Nancy the whole time. When we got near the Grand Canyon, Nancy started talking about how she always wanted to go see it. That was when George said those seven words I hated the most, "What my baby wants, my baby gets." He started going down a road that led to the Grand Canyon without even asking me. I started to get really annoyed, but decided not to say anything. It was really late, but they didn't care. It turned out the road that led to the Grand Canyon closed after a certain time. Nancy felt embarrassed, and George started apologizing to me. After we got back on the highway, I drove all the way to Chicago. George knew that I was bugged, so he tried to keep me company. He even told Nancy to sit in the back, which she did. It was a horrible drive. I couldn't believe I had to drive all the way back to Los Angeles with them.
