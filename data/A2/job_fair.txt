I hope I can find a job after graduation.
What is your major?
My major is geology.
Geology majors aren't very high in demand, but you'll do fine.
What makes you say that?
You're smart and likeable. Don't worry.
Thanks, but I'm still scared.
Oh, hey! You should go to the job fair.
We have that here?
Yes. Take advantage of it.
Have you ever been there?
Yes, and it's really helpful. Dress nicely!
