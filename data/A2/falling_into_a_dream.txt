Music had always played a big role in Jonathan's life. He liked different types of music, from Hip-Hop to Rock 'n' Roll. One of his favorite bands was The Beatles. He could hear them every day. Jonathan didn't feel that way towards any other band. He had all of their albums, and he knew all the lyrics to their songs.
 
One day, Jonathan and his girlfriend Sarah went for a ride in Jonathan's car. Sarah was excited to show Jonathan a new band she had heard about. Sarah brought the CD and played it for Jonathan as they drove around town. The first song was called 40 Day Dream, and the band's name was Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeroes. Jonathan didn't think much of them at first, maybe because he was driving, but after they stopped driving, he had the song stuck in his head.
Jonathan decided to look for their albums. They had three out, so Jonathan decided to buy them all. During a rainy day, Jonathan invited Sarah to his house and they listened to all three of their albums. Jonathan loved the band. He loved how they sounded like bands from the past. He loved how they reminded him of The Beatles.
When he and Sarah were listening to the third album, the song If I were Free came on. Jonathan jumped off his bed and started dancing alone. Sarah looked at him, smiled, and laughed. Jonathan started clapping, and then he started singing. "The light became too heavy, and I fell into a dream," he sang. He fell next to Sarah, looked at her and said, "I feel like I'm in a dream when I listen to this band. Thank you for introducing me to them."
