I think your grading policy is unfair.
I beg your pardon?!
Why is a 90% a B?
I'm trying to challenge you guys.
That's not a challenge, that's a punishment.
I've had this policy since I started teaching.
It's time for a change.
I'm not changing my policy because you don't like it.
Put yourself in my shoes.
I have been a student once, and I think my policy is fair.
I'm going to drop your class!
Go ahead! Less for me to grade!
