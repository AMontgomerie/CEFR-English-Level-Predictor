Johnny enjoyed walking around with his long black hair. He also enjoyed the attention strangers and friends would give him. Strolling down the street was never the same after he started doing it with long hair. Johnny never wanted to cut his hair short ever again. He could think of no good reason to do so. This would all change with one conversation on a Saturday morning while having breakfast with his parents.
 
It seemed like any other regular Saturday morning at Johnny's house. Mom was cooking pancakes; dad was reading the newspaper; Johnny was waiting, sitting at the table drinking some orange juice. "Johnny, it is time for you to get a job," Johnny's dad said all of a sudden, without any warning. Johnny nearly spit out his orange juice after hearing his dad's startling remark. "What?" Johnny said after gulping.
"There comes a time in every boy's life when he must finally cut his hair and get a job," Johnny's dad told him. "But, dad!" Johnny said, trying reasoning. "No buts," Johnny's dad snapped. That afternoon Johnny's parents took him to a barber shop to get a haircut. He tried his best to hold back his tears on the way to the barber shop.
Johnny reluctantly sat down on the barber's chair wearing a frown on his face. "Why the long face?" asked the barber. "He doesn't want to get a haircut," Johnny's mom replied. "It's just hair. It'll grow back one day," the barber said, trying to cheer him up.
The following week, Johnny was hired at McDonald's. He had neat, short hair.
