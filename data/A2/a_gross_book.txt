Ew! Look what I found in this book.
What is that?
It's a dead bug.
It's all squished and messy.
I can't read this book without being disgusted.
But don't you really want to check out this book?
I do, but I really can't.
I'll check it out then.
You can read it without being disgusted?
Yeah, I'll just skip that page.
There could be something really interesting on it.
Whatever! I'm just going to check out the book.
