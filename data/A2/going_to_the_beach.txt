Some of the most popular places to visit during summer are the beaches. Kenneth Green loved going to beaches. He lived close to Venice Beach, and could walk to the beach in 30 minutes. He could smell the ocean whenever he woke up. Kenneth and his friends decided to go to the beach the first day of the summer. When they got there, they found it was filled with tourists and people trying to escape the heat.
 
Even though the beach was filled with people, Kenneth didn't care. He knew all the cool places to go. He was friends with some shop owners. He was also friends with the owners of a little Mexican restaurant. He had a little booth reserved for him during the summer so that whenever he got hungry he didn't have to wait for a table. The owners were family friends of Kenneth and they loved having him around. Kenneth didn't like to abuse their relationship, so he only went to the restaurant once or twice a week, and he always left good tips.
There are a lot of activities to do at the beach. People can go swimming, rent a bike, play volleyball, or shop around. Kenneth is always careful when he is around volleyball nets and people bicycling. Last year, he was walking by the volleyball nets when a large man jumped up to hit the ball, which ended up hitting Kenneth right in the head. The man ran to Kenneth to make sure he was okay. He was okay, but a bit dizzy. As Kenneth was trying to get his balance back, he walked right into the path of a bicycle. He crashed into a woman riding a bicycle, and they both fell down. It wasn't Kenneth's favorite summer.
