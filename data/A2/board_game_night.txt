A great American tradition dating back to the birth of the country is the board game night. This is where two or more families get together at someone's home to have dinner, and refreshments, and then play games. This is an activity where almost anyone can play. Most board games can be played by children as young as 6, or 7 years old. It is fun for the kids to test their skills against their older brothers and sisters, or their parents. One of the oldest and most popular board games is Monopoly. It is a game where all players start in the same place, and roll dice to advance from square to square.
 
Little Johnny wanted to join the game one night, and asked his parents if he could play. "Please, mommy. Please let me play with you tonight," he pleaded. His mom thought about it for a while, and said, "Okay, Johnny. Tonight you can play." She really didn't think he was going to be able to play the game, but to her surprise, he was very good at it. The object of the game is to bankrupt your opponents and have most money at the end of the game. You buy properties with money collected by moving around the board. The more money you have in your bank, the more property you can buy.
Johnny landed on the Boardwalk square, which is a very prized property. It is the most expensive property, but Johnny knew its value and bought it. The square is positioned at the end of the game where everyone collects $200, but if you land on it, you have to pay a high rent. Johnny bought a couple of nearby properties too, and before long, he was collecting rent from all the other players. Johnny ended up winning the game, which made him very happy, and it also made his mom very proud of him. Johnny showed her and everyone else what he was capable of.
