Learning another language is a difficult task, but not impossible. Andrew knew the challenge that lied ahead, but was determined to achieve his goal of learning Spanish. Andrew wanted to learn Spanish because his girlfriend's family was from Guatemala. Andrew had already learned some basic words. Yes in Spanish was si, no was no, and thank you was gracias. It was just a matter of time before he became fluent and began talking to his girlfriend's relatives.
 
Andrew had been receiving lessons from his next door neighbor Jose. Jose was fluent in both Spanish and English. He was born in Mexico, and immigrated to the United States at the age of ten. Jose was happy to teach Andrew Spanish. Andrew insisted on paying Jose for the lessons, even though Jose had offered to do it for free. After a few months, Andrew was able to communicate well enough to hold a simple conversation. Andrew decided to test his Spanish by introducing himself in Spanish to his girlfriend.
"Hola, mi nombre es Andrew," Andrew said with a smile on his face. He had said in perfect Spanish, "Hello, my name is Andrew". His girlfriend was impressed at his Spanish as they shared a conversation about the weather. Jose's lessons had paid off.
Andrew realized that if he wished to keep progressing in learning Spanish, the best thing to do was to enroll in a Spanish course at the community college. That's exactly what he did the following day. Andrew asked some of his friends if they would like to learn Spanish with him at the community college. "No, thank you," most of them said. Andrew's friends thought it would be too hard to learn Spanish. Little did his friends know, Spanish wasn't that hard to learn. Andrew had learned this firsthand.
