Do you have a favorite genre of music?
No, but I have favorite bands.
What bands would you consider your favorites?
The Beatles are the first. Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros are the second.
Is that all?
No, I really like The Clash. They are third.
I've only heard of The Beatles.
You should check out the other two bands. They are good.
Do you have any of their music that you could show me?
Sure, come over to my house after school, and I will show you their music.
Great! I've been looking for new music to listen to.
Don't worry; I will get you into a lot of new stuff.
