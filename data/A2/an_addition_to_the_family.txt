I got out of school at 7 p.m. and didn't have anything to do, so I started walking home. I lived an hour away from my school, so I got home at around 8 p.m. When I opened the door to go inside, I saw my brother, my mom, and my brother's girlfriend all sitting down on the couch. My brother Jeff was sitting with his girlfriend Betty. I walked in slowly. I looked at my mom, who had tears in her eyes. It was very tense. I turned to Jeff. "She's pregnant!" Jeff said.
 
Jeff and his girlfriend started laughing and said, "Yes!" I started jumping up and down with joy. I always wanted to be an uncle. My first reaction was to start screaming, "It wasn't me! It wasn't me!" I started screaming that because my parents always thought I was going to be the first one to give them a grandchild. They certainly didn't think Jeff was going to do it. I gave them each a hug, and I wished them luck.
After eight and a half months had passed, Betty gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. My family and I were as happy as it could be. They named the baby Mark. Mark was the name of my father, who passed away a year ago. My brother said that he looked like my dad, so he decided to give him the name in honor of my dad. We all gathered at the hospital and started laughing, talking. We each took turns carrying the baby. It was the happiest moment in our family's history. We only wished that my father would have been a part of it. Jeff looked at baby Mark. He told me that my father's spirit was here. He would always be there to look over and take care of Mark. I smiled and gave him a hug.
