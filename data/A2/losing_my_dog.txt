It was Sunday, the last time I saw my dog. His name is Spot, because his whole body is covered with spots. He is a good dog. He never bites, and almost never barks. I got Spot when I was around 9 years old. All of my friends knew that Spot was like my best friend. So, when I told everyone that Spot had gotten lost, they all came out trying to help out. We looked for hours.
 
My dad told me that maybe Spot got picked up by a dog catcher. If that was true, then he would be at the dog pound, which is where they send all the dogs that get lost. My friend Mark told me that they put pictures of all the dogs they find in the street online, so I went online to try. I spent more than an hour checking the online pictures of the dogs, and finally found my Spot. I started jumping with joy.
I went with my mom and dad to pick up Spot. When we got there, he started barking and running in circles all around his cage. I knew he was happy to see us. He had been lost for about two weeks. When we got him home, he ran around the backyard and ran directly into his little house my dad and I built for him. He started barking really loudly, which is weird for Spot. As soon as my sister heard Spot, she came running out to try and catch him. He ran around her and then let himself be captured. I think he just wanted to be petted. I knew he was happy to be back home and even happier when I brought out his food. I hope Spot never gets lost again.
