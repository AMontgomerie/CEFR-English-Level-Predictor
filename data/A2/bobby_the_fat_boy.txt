Bobby loved to eat. He ate hamburgers, French fries, hot dogs, pizza, donuts, and ice-cream, just to name a few. No matter how much Bobby ate, he never got a stomachache. It is no surprise that Bobby weighs two hundred and fifty pounds. It might be surprising to know that Bobby is only fifteen years old. Bobby didn't care that he was big. He was content with how he looked and loved eating as much as he could.
 
Bobby liked to tell jokes to his friends. "Knock, knock," Bobby would say. "Who's there?" friends would ask. "Gorilla," Bobby replied. "Gorilla who?" they'd ask back. "Gorilla me a hamburger!" Bobby replied, delivering the punch line. The joke was in how the word gorilla sounded like grill. Bobby's joke always left people in stitches.
Even though Bobby was popular and friendly, he was still teased by some kids in school. Fat boy Bobby was the nick name the mean kids gave to Bobby. Whenever Bobby heard the nick name, he would reply with gusto, "sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me." The bullies would funnily reply, "I bet you would eat those sticks and stones, fat boy Bobby!" and scurry off running.
Bobby did not let idiotic name calling bother him. He had more important things to think about, like what he was going to eat for dinner. Bobby knew that one day he would have to lose weight if he wished to live a longer life. Until that day came, Bobby would continue eating what he wanted and as much he wanted.
