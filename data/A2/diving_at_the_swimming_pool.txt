Donald Walker always looked forward to summer. As he sat down in class, he thought about all the things he was going to do during his summer break. He even made a list. On the top of his list was swimming. Donald loved to go swimming. Even though he was excited to get a break, there was something, or someone he was going to miss. Sarah Lee Parker was his classmate, but he rarely talked to her. Donald liked Sarah a lot. He knew he was going to miss her.
 
The first day of summer had arrived. Donald woke up around noon. He hated waking up early for school, so he wanted to sleep late for the first day of summer. As soon as he woke up, he put on his swimming shorts, got a towel, kissed his mom goodbye, and ran to the park to go to the pool. As Donald jumped into the pool, his heart began to beat fast. The water was clear, but cold.
One of Donald's favorite things to do at the pool was to go on the diving board. As Donald stood on the edge of the diving board, he started jumping in order to get high enough to do a flip. He jumped once, and then twice. When he was about to jump off again, he saw that Sarah was looking at him from the entrance of the pool. Donald got so nervous that he couldn't finish the flip, and he landed on his back. Everyone in the deep end of the pool started laughing. Donald felt embarrassed as he swam to the edge of the pool, but when he got there he saw Sarah waiting for him. "Ouch, that had to hurt. You want to go swimming with me?" Sarah asked Donald. Donald said sure nervously, and started swimming with Sarah. Donald had never been happier, and never been in that much pain.
