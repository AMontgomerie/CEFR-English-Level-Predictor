What's your favorite movie?
"The Grand Budapest Hotel." Why do you ask?
I was wondering what types of movies you liked.
Well, that's my favorite movie, but I like all sorts of movies.
Oh, okay, but why do you like that movie so much?
Because it has action, adventure, comedy, and wonderful acting.
How many times would you say you have seen it?
Too many to say. I watch it at least twice a month.
Really, you like it that much?
It's a really good movie. You should watch it.
Could I borrow it? I don't have money to buy it.
Yes, I could lend you the movie, but be careful with it.
