Why were you absent yesterday?
Why do you care?
You should be thankful I care so much about your education.
The truth is, I didn't hear the alarm clock.
You missed out on a very important lecture.
It happens. I'll just ask my friend what was on the lecture.
Is she a good note taker?
I don't know. I guess?
If you were in class, you wouldn't have to rely on anyone's notes.
I can't change the past.
I know. Anyways, you should increase the volume on your alarm clock.
I suppose I could do that.
