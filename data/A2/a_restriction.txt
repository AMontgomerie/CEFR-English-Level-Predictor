I am so upset.
Oh, no. Talk to me about it.
I can't register for a class I really need.
Is it full?
I have a hold on my record, because my library books were overdue.
Can't you just pay the overdue fees?
I can't afford it. I'm totally broke.
How much do you need?
I need $50.
Wow, you must have kept those books long past the due date.
Yes, I know I am horrible.
I'll lend you the money.
