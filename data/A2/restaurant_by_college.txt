I am so sick of dining hall food.
Me too! It's so unhealthy.
We should go to a restaurant nearby.
Want to go to Health Nut?
What a funny name!
I like it!
Do they sell nuts?
I'm not sure. Anyways, I want to try their organic tofu.
I'm allergic to tofu.
That's okay! They serve a wide variety of food.
Great! I'm just glad we're not eating dining hall food.
Me too. Let's go!
