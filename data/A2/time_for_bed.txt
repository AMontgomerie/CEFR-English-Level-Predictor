Hello, is this the Smith residence?
Children, it's time to go to bed!
But we're not sleepy yet!
If you get into bed right now, I'll read you a fairytale.
One with a princess and a prince?
Of course, and a magical dragon, too.
Why do we hear fairytales before bed?
So that the magic from stories can grow while you're sleeping.
What does it grow into?
Why, magical dreams, of course!
Please read us two tonight!
Alright, but only if you sleep as soon as I'm done!
We will. It's a promise!
