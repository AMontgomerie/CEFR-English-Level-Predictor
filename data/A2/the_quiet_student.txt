Hi, I'm James. What's your name?
Hi James. My name is Lisa.
I'm taking this class because it seems interesting. Why are you?
I'm taking this class because it's a requirement.
We should get to know each other.
I don't think so. I like keeping to myself.
So you don't like meeting new students?
Nope. I would rather just be alone.
That is so sad!
It's not. It's really peaceful and self-empowering.
Can we at least study together?
Nope, we can't do that.
