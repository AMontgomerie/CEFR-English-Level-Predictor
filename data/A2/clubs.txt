College is so boring. All I do is go to class.
You should join some clubs.
Are you a part of any clubs?
Yes! I am currently in the Animal Lovers Club and the Knitting Club.
What do you do in the Animal Lovers Club?
We do a lot of things! Last week, we walked dogs.
That sounds fun. What's the wildest animal you ever interacted with?
I touched a dodo bird a couple weeks ago.
Dodo birds are extinct.
I'm just messing with you!
You're silly! Okay, I'll join the Animal Lovers Club.
Great! We always welcome new members.
