Patricia was happy that she was finally making friends since moving to Los Angeles from New York. She had left everything behind to move to be closer to her boyfriend. The first friend she made was Helen. Helen worked with Patricia at a clothing store in the local shopping mall. Sometimes Patricia would even see Helen on the freeway when they were working the same shift. Patricia thought that they must not live too far from one another. Helen confirmed this.
 
"My neighborhood is right next to yours," Helen told Patricia while they were both checking out customers. "Drop by anytime you want on a day when we're both not working," Helen said. Patricia took the invitation too literally. She was able to get Helen's address from their manager at work. "I want to surprise my new friend," Patricia told the manager. The manager thought that was sweet and without thinking about Helen's privacy, he passed the address onto Patricia. On a day that Patricia and Helen both had the day off, Patricia looked up Helen's address on her map application on her cell phone. Helen's house was only 10 minutes away.
Patricia followed the directions, and at 9:00 a.m., she rang the doorbell at 2374 Evergreen Avenue. It took Helen awhile to answer the door. She looked genuinely surprised, but also confused when she saw Patricia on her doorstep. "What are you doing here? How did you get my address?" Helen asked. She was still in her pajamas and her hair was a mess. "You told me to drop by anytime we both had a day off, so I got your address from our manager. I want to give you a surprise!" Patricia said. "I was just being polite. You can't just show up at someone's house!" Helen said before slamming the door on Patricia's face.
