Spring finally arrived. This past winter was a long, cold, and snowy one. Gonzalo was ready to get outdoors and play some sports. However, since Gonzalo was new in town, he didn't have that many friends. He decided to try and get some of his co-workers together. In the company lunchroom he put up a paper. The paper invited people to meet Gonzalo at a nearby park on Saturday for a game of football. Football was Gonzalo's favorite sport. He played it ever since he was a kid.
 
On Saturday morning, Gonzalo was excited to go to the park with his new friends to play some football. He was a little worried that people wouldn't show up. Gonzalo walked to the park early. He wanted to be the first one there to meet everyone. He packed his cleats and a ball in a backpack.
Gonzalo waited in an open field close to the entrance to the park. That way everyone could see him. He would also be preventing others from taking the space. Slowly but surely, Gonzalo's coworkers began coming into the park. Some of them even brought friends and family from outside of work. Gonzalo was certain they would have a great game.
"I brought a ball," Gonzalo told one of his coworkers Leo, who said he had also brought a ball. Leo said he was a huge football fan. Sometimes Leo even held parties at his house to watch football. Both Leo and Gonzalo went to their backpacks to get their balls. That's when they realized there had been a miscommunication.
Leo's ball was oblong and brown, while Gonzalo's ball was a round soccer ball. Gonzalo had forgotten that in the United States football and soccer were different sports. Leo had forgotten that, too. They compromised and played one game of soccer and one game of American football.
