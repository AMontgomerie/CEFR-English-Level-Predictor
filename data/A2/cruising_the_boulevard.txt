Steven Baker loves his car. He owns a beautiful 1977 Chevrolet Corvette that he bought many years ago. Steve, as he is known to his friends, got a great deal on the car. He bought it from a guy who was the original owner. This is the best possible situation a used car buyer can find. The car culture in California is unique. Detroit automakers look to California for trends to include into their car designs. Many people in California like lower cars, which make them look sleeker and more streamline. This comes from the practice of cruising the boulevard, an activity that is very popular among people of all ages, especially in Southern California.
 
It was Saturday night in August. Steve gave me a call to see what I was doing that night. "Hey, let's go cruising, brother," said Steve. And of course I said yes. I loved cruising in his car. The girls loved that car. It was a two-seater with a T-top roof that is removable. That night we cruised Van Nuys Blvd., a popular street where lots of young people like cruising. This is where guys can meet girls and vice versa. It wasn't long before we spotted a car load of girls in an old Ford Thunderbird. "Hey!" I shouted to the girls as we came up near them. "Anyone want to cruise with us?" I said, and to my surprise a couple of young blondes jumped in and we drove away. It was a tight fit, but the girls were small and thin. I was in heaven! Before long, I was dating one of them, and Steve dated the other.
We went on a few double dates after that, but Steve and his folks moved away one year later and I never heard from him again. That was a sad day in my life, but at least I had a new girlfriend, thanks to him and his 1977 Corvette!
