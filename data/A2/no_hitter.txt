Rocky was a big baseball fan. He lived in Philadelphia, but was originally from Los Angeles. He made sure to go watch the Dodgers every time they played the Phillies. Rocky will never forget the last game he saw at Citizen's Bank Ballpark, which is where the Phillies play.
 
It started off as a normal game for Rocky. He sat out in the stands with his girlfriend. He was fully dressed as a Dodgers fan. He had a Dodgers hat, jersey, and shirt. As the game came to the seventh inning, which is the seventh inning stretch and everyone starts singing "Take me out to the Ballpark," he noticed that the Dodgers pitcher Josh Beckett had been pitching a no-hitter. A no-hitter is when a pitcher doesn't allow a player on the other team to get a hit. Rocky got excited, because he never would have thought he would see a no-hitter, especially the Dodgers pitch a no-hitter.
Rocky was holding on to his beer, but he wasn't drinking it. He was watching the baseball game very closely. His girlfriend would talk, but he wouldn't listen. As Beckett threw the final pitch, Rocky held his breath. He saw that it was a strike and jumped out of his chair. He even spilled some of his beer on his girlfriend, but she didn't care. She was happy as well. Rocky was thrilled. He started yelling loudly. He celebrated with other Dodger fans that were there and drank the rest of his beer.
When he got home, Rocky turned on the television. He put the highlights of the game on ESPN and saw that he had come out on television. His girlfriend saw it and was excited. It was the best ending to the best baseball game he had ever been to.
