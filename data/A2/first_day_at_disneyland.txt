Disneyland is also called Magic Kingdom. It is located in Anaheim, California. The park opened in 1955, and was an instant success. When Anthony Martinez was a little boy, his brothers and sisters told him about Disneyland. At first, Anthony didn't know what they meant. He was just too young, and would call it "Dizzyland" as he couldn't pronounce it properly. His father had taken his older siblings to the park many times, but that was years ago. Anthony was much younger than his brothers and sisters.
 
For a long time, Anthony kept asking his parents to take him to Disneyland, but the feeling eventually wore off. He quit bugging his parents to take him. One day, when Anthony was about 8 years old, a classmate came to school bragging about his weekend at Disneyland. All of a sudden, Anthony wanted to go again. "Please, mommy, take me to Disneyland," Anthony pleaded to his mom. His dad heard it, and immediately told him "Okay, son, we're going this weekend for sure." Anthony's dad hadn't realized that his youngest child had never been there, and felt very bad about it.
The weekend came, and Anthony was so excited. He couldn't keep still. When they got into Disneyland, Anthony marveled at the castles and other attractions. He especially liked the life-sized characters that roamed the park. He grew up watching Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Now he was taking pictures with them. Anthony was "in heaven."
The best part of the theme park is the rides. "Can we go on the Captain Nemo Ride?" That question was soon followed by "Can we go on the Matterhorn?" Soon Anthony had gone on just about every ride. He was overwhelmed by the place. Soon the family was back in their SUV heading back home with Anthony fast asleep. It was the greatest day of his young life. A day he would later call "the best day of my life.".
