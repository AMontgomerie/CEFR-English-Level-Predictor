I really need a book, but I didn't see it on the shelf.
According to the computer, it's not checked out yet.
Then why isn't it on the proper shelf?
It means that someone in this library is holding it right now.
So someone else has the book and plans on checking it out?
Either that or someone took it out of the shelf and misplaced it.
I really need that book.
You're going to have to look everywhere for it.
Can't you just make an announcement asking whoever has the book to come forward?
You are not that special. When it comes to books, it's first come, first serve.
But I need it for school.
I'm sorry, but I can't do anything for you.
