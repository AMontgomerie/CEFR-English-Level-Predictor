I had the worst birthday of my life last year. It all started when my sister Donna invited my ex-girlfriend Jennifer. For some reason, Donna and Jennifer started getting along after we broke up. "How convenient," I told Jennifer. Donna was always trying to make my life hell. I guess that's her job as the older sister. She was 20 years old, while I turned 17 years old last year.
 
My mother had worked very hard to keep the party they were going to throw for me a secret. It didn't work, because Donna had a big mouth, but I was trying to keep up the secret for my mother's sake. My dad got home from work and told my mom to get the kids so that we could all go out for dinner.
We showed up at my favorite restaurant, which has a private room in the back for parties. Everything went downhill as soon as I opened the door. My other ex-girlfriend Sarah was there, because she wanted to try and fix our relationship. I'll never forget the look on Donna's eyes. She looked like she saw a ghost. Donna grabbed Jennifer and told her to go outside. Jennifer and Sarah never got along. It might have something to do with me, but I'm not sure.
Jennifer hadn't seen Sarah, because Donna took Jennifer outside before she had the chance. I took Sarah by the hand, and asked her who had invited her. She looked at me confused, because apparently I had invited her through a text message a week ago. It was true. I invited her, but I never thought she would show up. When Jennifer finally came into the room, she saw Sarah and became very angry. She looked at me and started yelling at me. "Why is she here, Jason?" asked Jennifer. I looked at her equally angry and said, "What are you talking about? What are YOU doing here?" Jennifer started yelling at Sarah, and Sarah started yelling at Jennifer. They got so angry that they started fighting, which eventually got us kicked out of the restaurant. My mother was crushed when she got there. Donna got grounded for a month. That was one horrible birthday.
