I was wondering if I could change my major from biology to political science.
Those majors are very different from each other.
I know, but I hate biology. I can't see myself studying it anymore.
You can change it, but you'll have to take more classes.
I don't mind. Political science is really interesting to me.
You would be graduating a year late.
Oh, no. I have to think a little more about this then.
I think you should change it, since you hate biology.
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry I am so indecisive.
A lot of people change majors. It's normal.
But not as late as I did. I hate that I'm graduating after all my friends.
You're making the right choice.
