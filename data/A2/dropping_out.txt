I have decided to drop out of college.
You're making the worst decision of your life.
I just don't get the point of college. It's just memorizing.
What are you going to do then?
I'm going to get a job!
As what? A burger flipper?
Don't be mean. I'm going to be rich and successful when I'm older.
It's almost impossible to be rich and successful without a college degree.
Look at Steve Jobs! He dropped out of college.
He's a rare case.
Watch me prove you wrong.
I'd like to see you try.
