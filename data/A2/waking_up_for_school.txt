Hello, is this the Smith residence?
Sarah! Hurry up and get out of bed!
I can't, the blankets won't let me go.
Quit being lazy and get up!
No, I have to finish my awesome dream!
I can't believe you turned off your alarm this morning.
Why? I do it every morning.
If you don't get out of bed, you'll get to school late.
That's not so bad.
How is it not so bad?
Sleep is good for growing children.
Yes, but you have a math test this morning!
I completely forgot! I'm up, I'm up!
