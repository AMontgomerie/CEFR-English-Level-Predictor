Are you okay? You look really sad.
I'm homesick. I feel so out of place here.
But this college is so awesome.
I know, but I really miss home.
How far do you live?
Far. Let's just say I need an airplane to get there.
It's almost winter break. Hang in there.
I don't think I can handle it anymore.
Try calling your friends and family from your hometown.
I don't want them to worry about me.
Just call them. Don't you want to stop feeling sad?
Okay, I'll call them now.
