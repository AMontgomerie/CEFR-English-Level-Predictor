 
John is a busy lawyer, whose whole day revolves around two things: work and his two daughters. Balancing the two things often proves to be very difficult, so John spends most of his day in a rush to do everything he needs to do, and get everywhere he needs to be. With such a hectic schedule, it is common to find John and his children in line at a McDonald's drive-thru, waiting for some burgers, fries, and shakes.
 
"I know fast food isn't the healthiest thing I could give my daughters," admits John. "But it's the most convenient thing around when we're in a rush. Plus, it makes them happy." Unfortunately, this attitude towards the unhealthiness of fast food is one that so many parents in the U.S. hold, and it is easy to understand why.
Nowadays, nearly every single city in America is equipped with its own McDonald's. In Los Angeles alone, it can sometimes feel like there is one on every other corner when you're driving around. As if this didn't already make it hard enough for parents to avoid, McDonald's targets their famous "Happy Meals" to children so that every time they drive by the giant golden arches, children demand to go inside to get a new toy with their meal.
Although it may be very hard for parents to have healthier meal options for their children, doing so is a necessity that this country can no longer ignore. Constantly consuming fast food is becoming a norm in American society and is resulting in millions of people suffering from obesity and diabetes for the rest of their lives. Instead of teaching children that it is okay to give in to the temptation of a quick greasy meal, parents should get their children into the habit of healthy eating everywhere they go. In the end, children will be more thankful for living long, healthy, and happy lives, than for getting a cheap toy in a cardboard box.
