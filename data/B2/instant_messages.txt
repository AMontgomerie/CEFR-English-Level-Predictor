You there, Beatriz?
Hang on, Andrew.
OK. What's up?
It's Caroline's birthday tomorrow.
Oh yeah, that's right!
You thought about what to get her?           
You mean a present? Weren't you buying one from both of us?
I'm sorry! It totally slipped my mind!

And I'm working 'til late.
So â€¦
Could you pick up a gift today?
I guess. What sort of thing were you thinking of?
Dunno. Got any ideas?
One sec. Phone.
OK, I'm back.
Just had an idea for a gift.
Go on.
New headphones?
Nah. Jeremy said he was getting her headphones.
OK. What then?
Have you seen those gift certificates for a spa? Maybe one of those?
She'd love that!
I'll pick it up today then.
Thanks a million. Appreciate it.
No worries. See you tomorrow then?
Yep.
What time was it again? 4?
