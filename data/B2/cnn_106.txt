Robin Williamsdaughter chose a hummingbird to honor her late father.
 For poppo, wrote Zelda Williams on her Instagram account Wednesday, posting the picture of a tattoo on what appears to be her right hand, above a tattoo of Robin's birthday, 7.21.51, written on her wrist.
 Thank you to the incomparable @dr_woo_ssc for so beautifully bringing my reminders to life, she wrote, thanking tattoo artist Dr. Woo of Mike Mahoney's Shamrock Social Club in Hollywood. I 'll always put my hand out to shake with a smile. 
 What a beautiful tribute to your father, a comedic genius ! wrote one follower.
Zelda Williams also warned her followers to avoid scammers asking for anything in her name.
 As for this Instagram, I do n't know in what capacity I 'll continue using it in the future, but I 'm leaving it up regardless so that fake accounts hoping to use my name or misuse my family's photos will get no traction. To be clear, this is MY ONLY account. Publicly, I have Twitter, and this.
 If other people post quotes and photos claiming to be me or my family, please, do not send them personal information or click links, even for charity. They could be utilizing sympathy to scam you. For the record, no one has ever or will ever speak for me but me. Thank you. 
Shortly after her father's suicide in August, Zelda Williams abandoned her Twitter and Instagram accounts after saying that some people had sent her messages blaming her for her father's death and sending her PhotoShopped images of her father's dead body.
