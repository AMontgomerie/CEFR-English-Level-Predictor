Johnny Depp is an American film star known for taking eccentric roles that many Hollywood stars would not. He has won two awards for best actor, including a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actor's Guild Award. Depp has played some of the most endearing characters in modern American film history, making him one of the most popular actors in America today.
 
Depp was born in Kentucky, but raised in Florida. He dropped out of school at the age of 15 to pursue a career as a Rock 'n' Roll musician. He gained very little success as a musician, and was introduced to acting by his former wife while they were visiting Los Angeles.
After debuting in A Nightmare on Elm Street, Depp got his first break when he was cast in the popular TV show 21 Jump Street. The show ran for several years, and Depp began getting noticed by Hollywood producers. His first huge hit was playing an artificial character in the film Edward Scissorhands. This role was the first of many odd characters played by Depp. Edward Scissorhands was critically acclaimed, and won several industry awards.
Depp followed his success in Edward Scissorhands with a series of strong roles. In 1999, he played Ichabod Crane in the movie Sleepy Hollow. His performance was well received by critics, and audiences alike. His most successful role was playing Captain Jack Sparrow in The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, another eccentric character. This role was described as a difficult one that only someone like Depp could pull off.
In 2005, Depp starred in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, playing once again a very eccentric character that lived in a chocolate factory.
