On one of New York City's most famous avenues, Fifth Avenue, is Museum Mile. Museum Mile is a 23-block stretch that holds some of the most famous museums in the world. Museum Mile begins at 85th Street and Fifth Avenue with the massive Metropolitan Museum of Art. Inside is thousands of years worth of art and artifacts. A visitor can visit an entire Egyptian tomb, sit in a Japanese style garden, view Renaissance paintings, and ancient Greek and Roman sculptures. There is even a gallery featuring musical instruments. In the summer, there is a rooftop garden where there are spectacular views of the city, especially of Central Park.
 
The Guggenheim, on 88th Street and Fifth Avenue, looks a little bit like a snail's shell from the outside. When it opened in the 1950's, the swirling architecture, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, was thought to be ugly by many. This museum focuses on modern art, but sometimes features special exhibits like one they had a few years ago of ancient Mexican ruins. The National Academy Museum and School of Fine Arts on 91st Street and Fifth Avenue is the city's oldest art school, dating back to 1825. The Jewish Museum on 93rd Street and Fifth Avenue, tells 4,000 years worth of Jewish History. Up ten blocks on 103rd Street and Fifth Avenue is the Museum of the City of New York, showcasing the history of the Big Apple from its colonial start.
One block up on 104th Street and Fifth Avenue is El Museo del Barrio. This museum started as a space to reflect the city's large Puerto Rican migrant community. Now it features exhibits focusing on art from all over Latin America. Across the avenue is the Central Park Conservatory Garden, with a fountain that has a sculpture of three dancing life-size women.
