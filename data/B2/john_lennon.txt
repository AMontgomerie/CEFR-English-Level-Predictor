John Lennon is one of the most complex individuals ever to walk the face of the earth. The British-born musician is a true international icon who influenced the world with his message of peace and love. In America, Lennon is one of the most loved people to ever call the United States home.
 
Lennon was one of the founding members of the international super group, the Beatles. He, along with Paul McCartney, formed the early creative brain trust of a group that changed music worldwide. The group’s success has never been duplicated, and its music is as popular today as it was in the 1960s and 70s.
Lennon wrote, or co-wrote some of the most memorable tunes ever written in the Rock ‘n’ Roll genre. He found great success as a member of the Beatles, which is the most commercially successful group in history, and as a solo artist. Lennon was also a political activist. His views on religion and politics caused a great deal of controversy in the United States. He was an outspoken critic of the country’s involvement in the Vietnam conflict. His popularity caused great concern with government officials because he had the attention of the young people in America at the time.
Lennon had been living in New York for several years, where he was being watched by the FBI in order to find grounds to deport him from the United States. He used flamboyant gimmicks to spread his word of peace. In this passive protest, Lennon and his wife Ono addressed the media from their beds claiming people should “make love, not war.” Lennon was killed on December 8, 1980 by a crazy gunman outside his home in New York City. A memorial plaque at the site of his death is one of the most visited sites in the country.
