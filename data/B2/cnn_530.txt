Pop-country singer Patti Page died on January 1st in Encinitas, California. She was 85.
Born Clara Ann Fowler, Page was the best-selling female artist of the 1950s and had 19 gold and 14 platinum singles. Page landed on the charts 111 times, and her blend of genres made her a traditional-pop icon. She scored her first million-selling track in 1950 with With My Eyes Wide Open, I 'm Dreaming, and sang hits like -LRB- How Much Is That -RRB- Doggie in the Window and Old Cape Cod. Her signature track, Tennessee Waltz, later became an official state song of Tennessee, and her popularity led to her own TV shows on CBS, NBC and ABC in the Fifties and film roles in the Sixties.
