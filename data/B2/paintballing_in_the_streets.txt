Scott received a paintball gun and some paintballs from his mom for his 16th birthday. When his mom gave him the present, she told him that she would take him to a paintball range with some of his friends. The range was in an open field and the company that owned the range provided safety equipment like padding and facemasks. Getting hit by a paintball hurt and could cause serious injury. The paintball range was 20 miles away, and Scott had to wait till the weekend to try out his new equipment. He didn't want to wait that long. He wanted to play with his new toy now.
 
When his mom was taking a nap, he texted a friend who lived down the block to meet him in front of his house. "I want to show you what I got for my birthday," Scott told his friend. He loaded up the paintball gun with the colored balls filled with brightly colored paint. He started shooting it at the trashcans that were on the curb. Just then a police patrol car was driving down the street. Scott missed the trashcans and ended up shooting a paintball right at the police car. The police thought they were under attack. Scott knew he had done something wrong and ran inside the house with his friend. Soon a police helicopter was flying overhead, and Scott could hear police sirens approaching his house.
The sounds of the helicopter and the sirens woke up Scott's mother. She looked out her window and saw a spotlight right on her house, and three police cars arrived. "What is going on?" she wondered aloud. She went to the living room and turned on the local news to see if there was any information about what was happening in her neighborhood.
