Some of the most majestic landscape views in California are the great California Redwood and Sequoia trees. These trees can be seen up close at Sequoia National Park in the southern Sierra Nevada mountain range, of Visalia. This central California region boasts more than 400,000 acres of natural beauty that is uniquely Californian. The park is known as the Land of the Giants because of its beautiful trees. The landscape features great mountains, foothills, deep canyons, a large cavern system, and, of course, the world's largest trees.
 
The park sits side by side with King's Canyon National Park in the stunning San Joaquin Valley. Sequoia National Park was officially established as a national park in the 1890s. It features 14 campsites that include picnic tables, fire rings for outdoor cooking, and food storage boxes. It is a great place for a family vacation with many of its campsites open year round. But the most popular attractions are its forests. The ancient trees are some of the oldest living organisms on earth, and draw millions of visitors worldwide. Redwood trees can reach heights of more than 375 feet. They are closely related to the Giant Sequoia trees, and are often mistaken for each other. They both are uniquely Californian, as they do not grow naturally in any other region in the world.
Redwood trees live up to 2,000 years, and have branches that grow up to five feet in diameter. Its bark can grow up to 12 inches thick. The Giant Sequoia trees can live up to an astonishing 3,000 years, and have branches up to eight feet in diameter. Its bark can grow to an amazing thickness of three feet. Both trees have dark brown bark, and look very similar, but the Redwood thrives in coastal climate, while the Sequoia exists in more mountainous areas. In either case, they are a must-see California attraction.
