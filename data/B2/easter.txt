Easter is a Christian holiday that celebrates the resurrection of the dead of Jesus Christ as told in the Bible. Christians are found in church on Easter. Some Christians participate in an Easter vigil or nighttime mass, sometimes held by candlelight. Easter is never on a set date. It is observed on a Sunday between the end of March and the end of April. The exact date is calculated based on a different calendar. Many public schools in the U.S. have a week-long vacation around Easter time. Sometimes this break is called Easter or Spring break.
 
In the United States, Easter is also celebrated as a secular holiday. It is associated with the beginning of spring and symbolized by bunnies, flowers, and dyed eggs. Many children in the U.S. believe in a fictional character called the Easter Bunny. According to the myth the Easter Bunny leaves baskets full of candy for children. Sometimes these baskets are hidden and the children have to find them on Easter Sunday morning. Candy that is usually inside an Easter basket can include chocolate in the shape of bunnies or chicks, jellybeans, and marshmallows.
Another activity associated with Easter is an Easter egg hunt. According to popular mythology, the Easter Bunny hides painted eggs and children need to find them. While real eggs used to be used, now it is common to use plastic eggs filled with candy. There are usually public Easter egg hunts in parks across the country. The White House even hosts an Easter egg hunt. Another Easter tradition associated with Easter is dying real eggs in different, usually pastel, colors like light pink, blue and yellow.
In New York City, people take to Fifth Avenue to participate in the Easter Parade. The Easter Parade isn't a parade with marching bands and floats. People walk up and down Fifth Avenue showing off elaborately decorated hats or Easter bonnets.
