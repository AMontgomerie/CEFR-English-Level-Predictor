Transformers actress Megan Fox said yes to ex-fiance Brian Austin Green's marriage proposal, just four months after calling off a two-year engagement with Green, her publicist confirmed.
Fox, 24, was so excited when Green, 36, popped the question on a Hawaii beach that she dropped the 2-carat diamond engagement ring into the sand, Us Weekly magazine reported.
Despite a lengthy search by hotel staffers, the ring was never found, the magazine reported.
Fox and Green began dating six years ago and became engaged for the first time in 2007. They broke it off last February.
Marriage may be easier for Fox now that she's out of the Transformers franchise. Director Michael Bay announced this month that she is being replaced as Shia LaBeouf's love interest by model-actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley for Transformers 3. 
Fox portrayed Mikaela Banes in the first Transformers and its sequel Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. 
Green spent a decade playing David Silver on the hit TV series Beverly Hills, 90210 until it was canceled in 2000.
