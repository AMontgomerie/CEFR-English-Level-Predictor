Former F1 champion Michael Schumacher has been discharged from a Swiss hospital and is returning to his home, where he 'll continue his recovery from head injuries suffered in a skiing accident last year, his spokeswoman said Tuesday.
 Considering the severe injuries he suffered, progress has been made in the past weeks and months, said Sabine Kehm.
 There is still, however, a long and difficult road ahead. 
Schumacher, 45, sustained severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on December 29.
His investigative team said it thinks the experienced skier hit a rock hidden beneath the snow while traversing an area between two marked pistes, which catapulted him face-first onto another rock.
He was treated first at a hospital in Grenoble, in France, and then in June moved to a hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland, near the Schumacher family home.
Kehm appealed, as she has previously, for the privacy of his family to be respected as Schumacher continues his recovery.
The German national is a seven-time world champion whose F1 racing career ended in 2012.
