Sofa for sale
This gorgeous brown sofa made by grandsofas.com is excellent quality and extremely comfortable. It is in immaculate condition (see photo) and comes with a 25-yr guarantee. Material is cotton and it has a cool modern feel.
Cushion covers are all removable and machine washable, with a quality foam filling, and it's super comfortable. Keeps its shape when you sit on it. The dark-coloured wooden legs can be easily removed to allow the sofa to fit through a standard doorway.
No wear and tear as we've only had it for two years and kept it in good condition. Sofa comes from a smoke-free, pet-free home. Only selling it due to moving house as the new place isn't big enough for the sofa.
