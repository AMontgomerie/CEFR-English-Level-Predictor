William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton was the 43rd American president, presiding over the country for eight years from 1993 to 2001. He was the third youngest president to hold the office, behind Theodore Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. Clinton was a very popular president, who led the country during one of the most successful eras in American history. His economic policies contributed greatly to the country's economic strength during his tenure. Clinton is a member of the Democratic Party, and served as governor of the state of Arkansas for two five-year terms. He is credited with overhauling the state's education system during his tenure.
 
Clinton presided over the longest, peacetime economic expansion in American history. He is married to Hillary Clinton who he met at Yale Law School. Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, after serving as senator of the state of New York from 2001 to 2009. Additionally, Hillary Clinton is considered one of the top prospects to gain the Democratic nomination for the presidential election in 2016. When Bill Clinton left office in 2001, he enjoyed the highest approval rating from the American public in the history of the United States, but his presidency was not without controversy.
Bill Clinton's presidency was marred by the Monica Lewinsky affair. Lewinski was a White House intern who engaged in sexual activity with the president. Bill Clinton denied any wrongdoing, but his political opponents, the Republicans, pursued Clinton in an effort to damage his reputation and the Democratic Party in general. Republican politicians tried to have Clinton impeached from office and dogged him for years. In the end, Clinton survived the controversy, and completed his successful term as president. Hillary stood by him during the dark times, and the couple remains together to this day.
