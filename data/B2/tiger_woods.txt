Golf is one of the most popular games in the United States today. There have been many great champions over the years like Arnold Palmer, and Jack Nicklaus, but none has seen success like Tiger Woods. His father was black; his mother was Thai. He was born and lived his early life in Thailand.
 
Woods joined the pro golf tour at the age of 20 in 1996, where he began setting records for winning championships at a young age. He was one of the most promising young stars to hit the tour in years, which led to Woods acquiring several, lucrative contracts with Nike, and Titleist. Woods became a very young millionaire. In 2001, Woods became the first player in history to hold the title in all four major golf tournaments. It seemed there was nothing this young man could not accomplish.
Woods grew up in Orange County, California, and studied for two years at prestigious Stanford University. Woods began playing golf at an early age, and before long was winning amateur championships regularly. He was the Professional Golfers Association (PGA) Rookie of the Year in 1996. He has been named PGA Player of the Year, and PGA Tour Player of the Year, 11 times each. He has also led the tour as the biggest money winner several years. He was married, and had two children. His life was presumed ideal, but that changed in 2009.
Woods was exposed as a womanizer by several women, following an alleged affair with a New York woman. Woods denied any wrongdoing, but eventually confessed to several "indiscretions". The controversy kept gaining momentum, and it eventually led to his divorce and the loss of endorsement money from the sponsors. Woods is back on the tour, but has not regained his proficiency as before.
