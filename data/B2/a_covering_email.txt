Dear Ms Jones,
I'm writing in response to your advertisement for a Digital Marketing Executive. My name is Susan Nelson and I'm a Social Media Marketing Assistant. I have had this job for the past two years and I believe I am the person you need for your new role.
The bulk of my work involves designing and implementing online marketing campaigns across a range of channels. I am very comfortable using analytics to assess campaign success and drive future initiatives. I work with a range of social media platforms and tools for digital marketing.  
I have always worked in the retail industry and am familiar with the seasonal nature of business such as yours and have the skills to push your business forward through creativity and innovation. I would very much like the opportunity to both bring my experience and enthusiasm to this role while continuing to develop professionally and personally.
Following initial research into your company I very much feel we would be a good fit for each other and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this position with you in person.  
Please find attached my CV.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely,
