If you have a low income, are elderly, or are disabled, there are a number of public housing options in the United States. Public housing options are run by the federal, state, and city government agencies. Living in public housing is often called "living in the projects", but this is a negative term based on stereotypes. Not all public housing options mean living in huge, run-down buildings with lots of crime.
 
Public housing programs come in all sizes and types. One type is a single-family house. Another type includes living in a high-rise building, or apartments in tall buildings. All public housing options are rental options, meaning you do not own the place where you live.
Eligibility for public housing is based on a number of factors. One factor is your annual gross income, meaning how much money you make in a year. Another factor is if you are elderly or have a disability. Another factor taken into consideration is your U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status. Most public housing options are only available to U.S. citizens or U.S. legal residents. Like with any rental, your references are checked to make sure you and your family will be good tenants. This means looking at your credit history and your criminal record. People with criminal records are usually banned or not allowed to use public housing options.
To find out if you are eligible for public housing, you need to visit a government housing assistance office close to you. You can find your local housing assistance office by checking the yellow pages or by looking online. You will have to fill out an application. On the application you will need to list the names, gender, and date of birth of all people who would be living in the house or apartment.
