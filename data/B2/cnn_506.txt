Fernando Torreshighly-anticipated switch to English champions Chelsea was completed just before Monday transfer window closed in a deal that his former team Liverpool said had broken the British record.
Chelsea's website reported that the Spain striker had signed a five-and-a-half-year contract, but did not disclose the fee -- which British media speculated would be about # 50 million -LRB- $80 million -RRB-.
However, it was still well short of the world-record $130 million that Spain's Real Madrid paid English club Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009.
In another deal confirmed late on Monday, Benfica said that Brazil defender David Luiz had joined Chelsea in a deal worth $34 million that saw Serbian midfielder Nemanja Matic sign for the Portuguese club.
 I am very happy with my transfer to Chelsea and I am looking forward very much to helping my new team-mates this season and for many years to come, 2010 World Cup winner Torres told the London side's website.
 Having played against Chelsea many times since coming to England, and in some very big games I will never forget, I know there are many great players here and I will work hard to win a place in the team. I hope I can score some important goals for the supporters to enjoy this season. 
The 26-year-old scored 65 goals in 102 Premier League appearances for Liverpool after joining from Atletico Madrid in 2007 in a # 20 million deal, netting 81 in 142 games in all competitions.
Torresmove followed the news that Liverpool had agreed a club-record fee for Newcastle's England striker Andy Carroll, who handed in a transfer request in the afternoon after the 18-time English champions made an improved bid.
Just before the 2300 GMT deadline, Liverpool confirmed that the 22-year-old had signed a contract until 2016. The fee was not disclosed but it reportedly surpassed the previous British record of # 33 million -LRB- $53 million -RRB- that Manchester City paid for Brazilian Robinho in 2008.
Will deadline-day spending buck the trend ?
Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich has been relatively quiet in transfer market for the past two seasons, but has this time backed coach Carlo Ancelotti with two marquee signings as his club languish fourth in the table -- 10 points behind leaders Manchester United.
The London team also announced on Monday that the Chelsea FC plc made a loss of # 70.9 million -LRB- $113 million -RRB- for the year ended June 30, 2010.
 The reduction in operating losses and increased sales in 2009-10 shows that we are moving in the right direction especially when viewed against the difficult macroeconomic environment, chief executive Ron Gourlay told Chelsea's website.
 The club is in a strong position to meet the challenges of UEFA financial fair playinitiatives which will be relevant to the financial statements to be released in early 2013.
