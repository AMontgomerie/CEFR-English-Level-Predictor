Deep learning is at the heart of the current rise of artificial intelligence. In the field of computer
vision, it has become the workhorse for applications ranging from self-driving cars to surveillance and
security. Whereas, deep neural networks have demonstrated phenomenal success (often beyond human
capabilities) in solving complex problems, recent studies show that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks
in the form of subtle perturbations to inputs that lead a model to predict incorrect outputs. For images,
such perturbations are often too small to be perceptible, yet they completely fool the deep learning models.
Adversarial attacks pose a serious threat to the success of deep learning in practice. This fact has recently
led to a large influx of contributions in this direction. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on
adversarial attacks on deep learning in computer vision. We review the works that design adversarial attacks,
analyze the existence of such attacks and propose defenses against them. To emphasize that adversarial
attacks are possible in practical conditions, we separately review the contributions that evaluate adversarial
attacks in the real-world scenarios. Finally, drawing on the reviewed literature, we provide a broader outlook
of this research direction.

I. INTRODUCTION
Deep Learning [1] is providing major breakthroughs in solving the problems that have withstood many attempts of
machine learning and artificial intelligence community in
the past. As a result, it is currently being used to decipher
hard scientific problems at an unprecedented scale, e.g. in
reconstruction of brain circuits [2]; analysis of mutations in
DNA [3]; prediction of structure-activity of potential drug
molecules [4], and analyzing the particle accelerator data [5]
[6]. Deep neural networks have also become the preferred
choice to solve many challenging tasks in speech recognition [7] and natural language understanding [8].
In the field of Computer Vision, deep learning became the
center of attention after Krizhevsky et al. [9] demonstrated the
impressive performance of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) [10] based model on a very challenging large-scale
visual recognition task [11] in 2012. A significant credit for
the current popularity of deep learning can also be attributed
to this seminal work. Since 2012, the Computer Vision community has made numerous valuable contributions to deep
learning research, enabling it to provide solutions for the
problems encountered in medical science [21] to mobile
applications [179]. The recent breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the form of tabula-rasa learning of AlphaGo
Zero [14] also owes a fair share to deep Residual Networks
(ResNets) [15] that were originally proposed for the task of
image recognition.
With the continuous improvements of deep neural network
models [15], [144], [166]; open access to efficient deep learning software libraries [175]â€“[177]; and easy availability of
hardware required to train complex models, deep learning
is fast achieving the maturity to enter into safety and security critical applications, e.g. self driving cars [12], [180],
surveillance [13], maleware detection [34], [107], drones and
robotics [155], [178], and voice command recognition [7].
With the recent real-world developments like facial recognition ATM [181] and Face ID security on mobile phones [182],
it is apparent that deep learning solutions, especially those
originating from Computer Vision problems are about to play
a major role in our day-to-day lives.
