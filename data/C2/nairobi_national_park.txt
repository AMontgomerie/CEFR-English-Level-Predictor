Nairobi National Park is a protected ecosystem where various types of wildlife find hiding place. The
park has in the recent past experienced destruction through construction of a standard gauge railway
(SGR) line and a highway called the Southern bypass. These developments raise concern with the
possibility that their combined environmental cost being enormous. This study sought to determine the
willingness to pay (WTP) for the restoration of the park attributes using discrete choice experiment. The
focus was on the attributes of (1) wildlife population and diversity of species, (2) wildlife movement in
dispersion and migration areas, (3) vegetation density and diversity, (4) security of wildlife and people,
and (5) environmental safety and quality. The data used was collected from 93 students of Kisii
University, Nairobi campus. A price attribute in form of an increase in gate fee was included to elicit
WTP estimates. Multinomial logit regression estimates indicated that respondents were WTP for the
restoration of all the attributes except attribute 4. Attributes 1 and 2 elicited the highest WTP and could
be the most affected by the two projects. Middle-aged respondents with stable jobs were likely to pay
more for the restoration of the attributes compared to students and the youth. Based on the findings,
the government could consider relocating the park to a place with better environmental attributes.
Key words: Nairobi National Park, ecosystem, discrete choice experiment, willingness to pay, park attributes,
Multinomial logit.
INTRODUCTION
Nairobi National Park (NNP) ecosystem provides
numerous use benefits (direct and indirect) and non-use
benefits that include existence, option and bequest
values. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005)
defines ecosystem as a complex and dynamic
environment where living organisms (plants, animals and
microorganisms) and non-living organisms interact and
function as a unit. An ecosystem provides services to
human beings that the World Resources Institute (2005)
defines as benefits.
The park is Kenya’s oldest dating back to 1946. It
measures approximately 117 km2
and is situated at 7 km
south of Nairobi’s central business district (GoK, 2012).
Perhaps Kenya is the only country in the world with a
national park in its capital city. According to the Kenya
Wildlife Service (KWS), the park is home to over 100
mammalian species including the endangered black
rhino, four of the big five wildlife (lion, buffalo, leopard

and rhino) and over 400 species of migratory and
endemic bird species. The park also, provides sites for
wildlife and bird viewing, picnics, campsites and walking
trails. The park currently charges gate fee of Ksh 430 to
citizens and Ksh 4300 to foreigners. Approximately
278,700 tourists, both local and international, visited the
park in 2017, this makes the park a significant contributor
to the tourism industry (KNBS, 2018).
Nairobi National Park is protected and regulated by The
Constitution of Kenya (2010), the Wildlife Conservation
and Management Act (2013) and the Environmental
Management and Conservation Act (1999). These
statutes provide the legal framework for protection,
sustainable management and use of the country’s
environment and natural resources (GoK, 1999, 2010,
2013).
