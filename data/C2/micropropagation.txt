Land threatens the overall economy of Ethiopia.
Particularly, the agricultural sector which is a source of
45% of the country‟s GDP and 85% of employment is
highly vulnerable to the problem of land degradation
(Gebrelibanos and Abdi, 2012; MoFED, 2013). Based on
this, the creation of conducive atmosphere for better
performance of the agricultural sector is not only an
important and realistic option to improve food security
status of Ethiopians but also a means to improve their
standard of living. However, recently due to changes in
watersheds in general and land degradation in particular
which resulted from a range of natural and anthropogenic
factors, the agricultural sector has been challenged and
the extent of fertile land available for this sector is
decreasing; this can reduce productivity, household‟s
food security, and aggravate poverty in degraded areas
of the country (MoA, 2012; Teklewold and Kohlin, 2011;
Gebrelibanos and Abdi, 2012).
On the other hand, Woldeamlak (2003), Mushir and
Kedru (2012), Abebaw et al. (2011), FAO (2012),
Befikadu and Frank (2015) argued that land management
practices in Ethiopia have fallen far below expectations
and land degradation mainly caused by erosion remains
widespread in the country. They further argued that the
adoption rate of conservation practices by farmers
remains limited and still the country is losing a
tremendous amount of fertile top soil, and the threat of
land degradation is broadening alarmingly. In view of this,
the Ethiopian Government and other developmental
partners have introduced an extensive mechanical and
biological watershed conservation schemes in various
parts of the country over the last decades particularly
after the famine of the 1970s (Emily and Fanaye, 2012;
Binyam and Desale, 2014).
